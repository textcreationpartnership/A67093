            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He principal deſigne of the enſuing Treatiſe, is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and increaſe of the moſt excellent Liquor this Iſle of <hi>Great Britain</hi> affords; which hath of late years been brought into uſe, and very much admired by moſt, through the means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of many worthy perſons who have very much added to its reputation. Yet is it not become ſo general a Drink as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it may be in time, becauſe the greater part of the people of <hi>England</hi> are not as yet convinced of the advantage that will ariſe by the propagation of the Trees that yield this noble Drink, nor acquainted with the right method of planting them: Neither do they underſtand the true and genuine way of extracting or preparing it; Which
<pb facs="tcp:101529:4"/> hath been the occaſion that many have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt it for a mean dull Drink.</p>
            <p>Thus hath this Liquor been undervalued by the ignorant, which did prevent a long time many from undertaking its improvement. The Planters alſo have been diſcourag'd either by the difficulty of raiſing the Trees, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them not to agree well with the Soil; or in preſerving them, when raiſed, from Cattle, and other injuries; and the fruit from ſuch caſualties they are uſually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto: many alſo being not as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the ſalubrity and pleaſantneſs of the Drink it ſelf. Therefore is this ſmall Tract adventuring into the world in a plain and homely dreſs, to endeavour a Conviction of the Country-man, not only of the feaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Raiſing, Propagating, and Planting of <hi>Apple-trees,</hi> or other Fruit-trees, in moſt places or Soils in this Iſland, and that to a conſiderable improvement and advantage of their Farms or Livings ſmall and great; but alſo of the times and ſeaſons of gathering the Fruits, and the true and right method of Grinding, Preſſing, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their Juices, and fermenting, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, and preſerving the ſame when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, after the moſt genuine and beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented ways that have been yet known,
<pb facs="tcp:101529:4"/> diſcovered, or made uſe of. For this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor <hi>Cider</hi> hath been improved even to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as many ingenious and worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can teſtifie; and the Method thereof may in time become practicable by the moſt vulgar Capacities, from whom is expected the more <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal advancement of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne; into whom it is not eaſie to infuſe any thing that is Novel, although it be ne're ſo feaſible, or to be deſir'd; as might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in ſeveral points of <hi>Agriculture,</hi> that by degrees have been introduc'd, and now become generally practiced, which by them were once ſlighted and deſpiſed: there being no argument ſo prevalent with them as Profit; nor that to be talked of, unleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by plain Experience, which in this Tract I hope will be done to their ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. However, they need no better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convince them of the profits that ariſe from this part of Husbandry, than that many places in <hi>Herefordſhire, Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhire; Worceſterſhire,</hi> &amp;c. are highly improved by this very Method; the <hi>Cider</hi> there made being in great quantities annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally carried to <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral other places of this Kingdom, and ſold at a very high rate; and valued above the Wines of <hi>France,</hi> partly from the excellencie of it
<pb facs="tcp:101529:5"/> in it ſelf, and partly from the alteration for the worſe that French Wines ſuffer by their exportation, and from the ſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and adulterations they receive from thoſe that trade in them; which by the ill effects of the latter, oppoſed to the vertues and pre-excellencie of the former, in all probability will ſo far encreaſe and promote the Reputation of <hi>Cider,</hi> that it will not only continue the price and value of it, but rather enhanſe it, as the Planters and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deriſts grow more expert in planting the beſt Fruits, and preparing the Liquors after the beſt methods. For vain and frivolous is the Objection that is uſually made, That by much planting of theſe Fruits, the prices of them will be ſo low, that they will not quit the coſt. The ſame might have been made in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and places adjacent, where theſe Trees in late years are wonderfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; yet in the ſame places, the Fruit as well as the Cider yields a greater price now than ever it did formerly, or than it doth in any place of <hi>England</hi> (diſtant from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don)</hi> beſides: For within theſe three years <hi>Redſtreak-Apples</hi> have, in ſome part of that County, been ſold after the rate of five ſhillings the Buſhel, and the <hi>Cider</hi> made of that Fruit been ſold for eight pounds the
<pb facs="tcp:101529:5"/> Hogſhead. The ſame may be expected in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, if Husbandmen would take care to plant the beſt Fruits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it being preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that <hi>Cider</hi> in a little time would wear out the Reputation of French Wines, and by degrees leſſen the expence of Malt; it being much to be preferr'd to the former, and found by experience to be more wholſome than the Drink made of the latter; and may in time be made at an eaſier rate than Ale or Beer, and yet be a great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſidering that an Acre of Land planted with Apple-trees, will by its Fruit yield more Liquor than two or three Acres of Barly can make; and that without the annual charge of Plowing, Sowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the main Objection that may be made by the more ſober part of this Nation, is, That the increaſe of theſe intoxicating and inebriating Liquors, is an encouragement to the univerſal vice of Drunkenneſs. To which it may be anſwered, That that vice is not now ſo regnant in this Iſle, as it hath been in former Ages, and now is in other <hi>European</hi> Nations, if Hiſtory may be credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As in <hi>Virgil</hi>'s time, Drinking and Quaffing to their God <hi>Bacchus</hi> was in uſe; that art being then much in requeſt, and the Goat made a Sacrifice to that God, for crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb facs="tcp:101529:6"/> the tender ſprigs of the <hi>Vine</hi> that yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their beloved Liquor.</p>

            <p>And after him, <hi>Pliny</hi> reports that Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs and Debauchery were the principal Studies of thoſe times and Countries; they then inventing all ways imaginable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Appetite, as if they had been born
<pb facs="tcp:101529:6"/> into the world to no other end but to waſte good Wine; giving great rewards to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Drinkers. He tells us the <hi>Parthians</hi> then contended for the glory of exceſſive Wine-drinking; but the <hi>Italians</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with that honour. <hi>Milain</hi> yielding one <hi>Novellius Torquatus,</hi> that wan the name from all pretenders at that time, who had gone through all honourable degrees of Dignity in <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein the greateſt Repute he obtained, was for drinking in the preſence of <hi>Tiberius</hi> three Gallons of Wine at one draught, and before he drew his breath again: Neither did he reſt there, but he ſo far had acquired the Art of Drinking, that although he continued at it, yet was never known to faulter in his tongue; and were it ne're ſo late in the evening he followed this Exerciſe, yet would he be ready for it again in the morning. Thoſe large Draughts he alſo drank at one breath, without leaving in the Cup ſo much as would daſh againſt the Pavement. The <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts of the world, and namely <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were by <hi>Pliny</hi> cenſured for their Drunkenneſs with Beer and Ale, Wines being not there in that Age ſo frequent. For <hi>Italy</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all parts of the world for its curious Wines, there being reckoned 195 ſorts of
<pb facs="tcp:101529:7"/> Wines. <hi>Virgil</hi> counted them innumerable.</p>
            <l>Sed neque quàm multae Species, nec nomina quae ſint</l>
            <l>Eſt Numerus.—</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Their Names and Kinds innumerable are,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nor for their Catalogue we need not care;</hi>

            <p>But at this day no Country yieldeth more variety, nor more pleaſant Wines than <hi>Italy.</hi> In <hi>Rome</hi> are now drank (ſaith an Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of their own) eight and twenty diſtinct ſorts of excellent Wines; and, as is reported, their <hi>Lachrymae Chriſti</hi> exceedeth, for its pleaſant and exhilerating quality. So at this day the <hi>Germans</hi> are much given to Drunkenneſs, as one of their own Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men writes of them; that they drink ſo immodeſtly and immoderately at their Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, that they cannot pour it in faſt enough with the ordinary Quaffing-Cups, but drink in large Tankards, whole draughts, none to be left under ſevere penalties; admiring him that will drink moſt, and hating him that will not pledge them. The <hi>Dutch-men</hi> are
<pb facs="tcp:101529:7"/> not behinde-hand with them; inviting all Comers with a Pail and a Diſh, making Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of their Bellies. In <hi>Poland,</hi> he is most accounted of that will drink moſt Healths; and held to be the braveſt Fellow, that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his Liquor best; being of opinion, that there is as much Valour to be found in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as in fighting. The <hi>Ruſſians, Swedes, Danes,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Northern</hi> Inhabitants, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all the reſt, having made the drinking of <hi>Brandy, Aqua Vitae, Hydromel, Beer, Mum, Meth,</hi> and other Liquors in great quanties, ſo familiar to them, that they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually drink our Country-men to death: Prieſts and people, men and women, old and young do ſo delight in drunkenneſs, that they are daily early and late found wallowing in the ſtreets. So that comparing other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Ages with this of ours, we may well conclude, that the Inhabitants as well as the Air of <hi>Great Britain</hi> are temperate, not too prone to thoſe Vices other places are ſubject unto; and may juſtly give them the Character that was given to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> That <hi>Temperance</hi> is their chiefest Vertue: yet not to be abſolutely excuſed; for in the best Gardens ſome weeds grow, and amongſt the moſt civil, ſome rude and debauch'd are to be found. There is ſcarce any part of
<pb facs="tcp:101529:8"/> the world, but ſome of its Inhabitants are addicted to the drinking of intoxicating Liquours; which Nature hath prompted them unto, thereby to ſuffocate the thoughts of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, proper only to Mankind. The very <hi>Africans, Americans,</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them, although they were not very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in their preparation; but the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> inſtead of Liquors uſed the fume of a Plant, that produced the ſame effect; whom we think no diſhonour to imitate, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to exceſs; and it's probable out-do them in their own Invention, not eſteeming it a Vice. The <hi>Mahometans,</hi> which poſſeſs a great part of the world (it's true) on a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious account forbear the drinking of much Wine; becauſe that a young and beautiful Woman being accoſted by two Angels (that had intoxicated themſelves with it) taking the advantage of their Ebriety, made her eſcape, and was for her Beauty and Wit preferr'd in Heaven, and the Angels ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their folly: For which reaſon, they are commanded not to drink Wine. Yet many of them doubting of the Divinity of that Relation, do tranſgreſs that Command, and liberally drink of the Blood of the Grape, which the Chriſtians prepare out of their own Vineyards, palliating their Crime,
<pb facs="tcp:101529:8"/> in that they did not plant the Tree, nor make the Wine: The reſt of them for the moſt part taking great quantities of <hi>Opium,</hi> which hath a ſtupifying quality with it; and this generally when they are to look Death in the face. The <hi>Chineſes,</hi> and the other Inhabitants of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> are the leaſt addicted to Ebriety, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting themſelves with <hi>Coffee, The,</hi> and ſuch-like Drinks, free from thoſe ſtupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualities: yet are they not without their Carouſes; and thoſe of the intoxicating Drinks prepared of <hi>Rice, Coco's, Sugar, Dates,</hi> &amp;c. equalling in ſtrength and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit any Liquors in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore may we very well excuſe our own Nation in the ſlender exerciſe of this Vice, were they ſatisfied with our own pleaſant and ſalubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Drinks, and did not ſpend their Healths, Lives, and Eſtates, as ſome are apt to do, on ſuch that are forreign and pernicious.</p>
            <p>And it is to be hoped, that if the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> which are for the moſt part Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords of many fruitful <hi>Villa</hi>'s, will but ſet their own hands to the Spade, and encourage their Tenants therein, which now delight more in the Plow; in a little time, the plenty and excellencie of our own, may extirpate the name of forreign Drinks. This being one
<pb facs="tcp:101529:9"/> of the moſt principal and univerſal points of Husbandry; <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> being the chief ſupports of mans life: And this being of all parts of <hi>Agriculture</hi> the moſt pleaſant; the Plow carrying with it, many times, more care, coſt, and hazard, and not affording the tenth of that pleaſure, as this Art of Planting doth; it giving you one of the nobleſt Oblectations the world affords; and hath by its infinity of delight, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected unto it the Spirits of <hi>Emperours, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Senators.</hi>

            <p>Many more Examples might be here enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated; but I hope the more Ingenious part of Engliſh-men will be eaſily convinc'd of the pleaſure of this Exerciſe, and of the advantage alſo that it will bring to them and the Nation in general. It may be alſo objected, that the uſe of <hi>Cider</hi> being now
<pb facs="tcp:101529:9"/> common, and the planting of Fruit-trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come univerſal in this Iſle, and <hi>Cider</hi> made almoſt in every Village, and many Tracts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready written that contain in them the moſt excellent Precepts, Rules, Obſervations, and Experiments that can be imagined, for the propagating of the Trees, and making this Liquor, That this ſucceeding Tract may be needleſs. To which I anſwer, that although in ſome part it may ſeem to be true what is here objected, yet is not the uſe of <hi>Cider</hi> fully known, nor the planting of Trees ſo much encreaſed, as to amount unto a twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part of what in probability it may be in a few years; neither doth one in ten of ſubſtantial Houſekeepers in the greateſt part of the Nation make, or ſcarce know how to make this Drink. And as for the Books that treat of this Subject, they are but few; and what is mentioned in them of it, is but here and there a little. The moſt, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that is written of it well, is in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Tract of Mr. <hi>Evelin</hi> (his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> at the end of his Voluminous <hi>Sylva)</hi> which every one that may be capable of a ſmall Plantation, is not willing to purchaſe.

Therefore, before I begin this Diſcourſe, it will not be amiſs to give the Reader a brief Account of ſuch diverſe Subjects or Materials, out of which they are extracted or prepared; that he may obſerve how induſtrious the Inhabitants of this Globe have been in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part thereof, (as it were by an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent) in ſearching into the ſeveral
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101529:15"/> natures of Plants and Fruits, to exhauſt their Bloud and Tinctures, to gratifie their Guſts, and pleaſe their Fancies; that from the moſt remote <hi>American,</hi> to the extremeſt <hi>Aſian,</hi> they ſeem to accord in this, That that Liquor, out of whatſoever ſalubrious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extracted, which will moſt intoxicate, is to be highly eſteemed of; which in every Country in the world, either ſome <hi>Root, Plant, Fruit,</hi> or <hi>Grain</hi> will yield, if by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art it be rightly prepared.</p>

               <p>As the <hi>Palm-wine</hi> is made of the Sap of the <hi>Palm tree;</hi> which the <hi>Africans</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> extract, either by plucking off the Flower, and faſtening a Pot to the end of the Sprig into which the Liquour will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil; or by boring a hole in the Tree, and hanging a Pot under the ſame to receive it: which in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> they call <hi>Sura,</hi> in colour reſembling Whey; and at the firſt drawing is ſweet and pleaſant like Wine. This Liquor boiled they call <hi>Terry,</hi> and will keep ſome time; but if unboiled, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly turns into very good Vinegar. This Wine intoxicates the Brain, and inebriates
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101529:15"/> as other Liquors do: if diſtilled, it makes Strong-water; if Raiſins of the Sun are infuſed in it, with ſome other the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, it meliorateth the ſame excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. Out of one Tree, two Gallons of this Liquor may be drawn in a day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any damage to the Tree: Yet ſome have reported, that it hinders the ripening of the Fruit, and that you muſt expect no Fruit from the Tree out of which you thus extract its blood; which may be ſuppoſed to happen, when too much is drawn, or in too dry or late a Seaſon.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s they extract Wine out of another Tree, there called <hi>Laudan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Caribbe Iſlands</hi> is a prickly or thorny <hi>Palm,</hi> out of which is alſo extracted a <hi>Wine,</hi> after the ſame manner as before.</p>
               <p>Alſo out of the <hi>Birch-tree</hi> may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a pleaſant Liquor, which being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and uſeful, and to be obtained in this Climate, the manner of drawing and ordering it you ſhall finde in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Coco-Nuts</hi> yield alſo a Milk or Oyl, uſed in the Countries where they grow for Drink; but being gathered green, they give a very pleaſant and thin Juice, which the Natives drink of whilſt it is freſh.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Negroland</hi> are ſeveral Fruits that yield <hi>Wine,</hi> in great eſteem among the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as <hi>Sebankou</hi> and <hi>Syby-Wine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Jamaica</hi> and <hi>Braſilia,</hi> grows the Fruit <hi>Ananas,</hi> on a ſtalk of a foot long, ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſixteen ſharp Leaves, between which is the Fruit like a <hi>Pine-apple,</hi> but much bigger; the innermoſt pulp whereof melts on the tongue, and is of ſo delicious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101529:16"/> a taſte, that it exceeds all other dainties: Of this Fruit is made a Drink no way inferior to <hi>Malvaſia-Wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Pomegranate</hi> is extracted an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Juice, where plenty of them is to be had.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chineſes</hi> make a Drink of a ſort of Fruit there, that grows on a Tree beſet with Thorns like the <hi>Lemon-tree:</hi> the Fruit is neer as large as a mans head, with a Shell over it; the Pap within is reddiſh, and ſour-ſweet like unripe Grapes.</p>
               <p>

               <p>In the <hi>Caribbe</hi> Iſlands, the Tree <hi>Acajou</hi> bears a Fruit like a very fair Apple, of which the Iſlanders make a Drink very much in eſteem among them, being of an excellent taſte.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Chili</hi> grows the <hi>

               <p>In <hi>Braſilia</hi> is uſed a Drink called <hi>Pacobi,</hi> made of the Fruit of the Tree <hi>Pacobebe:</hi> They alſo make the Drink <hi>Caoi,</hi> of the Fruit of the <hi>Ocaijba-tree,</hi> which being ſtamped in an wooden Mortar, and ſtrein'd, it firſt

               <p>The <hi>Africans</hi> in <hi>Negro-land</hi> brew their Beer of <hi>Mille,</hi> which they ſteep in water till it ſhoots, and then dry it in the Sun, and ſtamp it to Meal in great Mortars, with whom Mills are not yet in uſe; then they pour on it boiling-hot water; they make it alſo ferment with Yeaſt, imitating thereby our <hi>European</hi> Malt-drink. It is probable this <hi>Mille</hi> is the ſame with that <hi>Millet</hi> with which the <hi>Dageſtan Tartars</hi> make their <hi>Brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> which they eſteem very delicious, drink freely of it, and grow ſuddenly drunk therewith.</p>
               <p>On the Coaſt of <hi>Chili</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> the Inhabitants make a Liquor of <hi>Mays,</hi> which grows there in abundance: they ferment it like our <hi>Ale,</hi> and drank mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, it refreſheth; but the Inhabitants
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101529:17"/> uſually follow it ſo cloſe, till they are mad-drunk.</p>
               <p>They make alſo a very pleaſant Drink of the Grain <hi>Teca,</hi> dried in the Sun, thraſh'd, and parch'd in hot Sand, then ground on a ſquare flat Stone, with a Roller of ſtone, and infuſed in a great quantity of water.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chineſes</hi> make excellent Drink of <hi>Rice,</hi> which is very pleaſant of taſte, and preferred by them before Wine.</p>
               <p>In the Iſle <hi>Formoſa</hi> not far from <hi>China,</hi> the Natives make a Drink as ſtrong and intoxicative as Sack, out of <hi>Rice,</hi> which they ſoak in warm water, and then beat it to a Paſte in a Mortar; then they chew ſome <hi>Rice-meal</hi> in their mouths, which they ſpit into a Pot till they have got about a quart of Liquor, which they put to the Paſte inſtead of Leaven or Ferment: And after all be kneaded together till it be Dough, they put it into a great Earthen pot, which they fill up with water, and ſo let it remain for two months; by which means they make one of the moſt pleaſant Liquors a man need drink: the older, the better and ſweeter, although you keep it five and twenty or thirty years.</p>

               <p>The Juice of the Apple, <hi>Cider,</hi> is for the ſame cauſe preferred on this ſide the 49 degree of Latitude, where the Bloud of the Grape obtains not that degree of Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Fruit, as in the more hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: And the Apple being but a pulpy Fruit, not enduring thoſe exceſſive heats and droughts thoſe Countries beyond that degree, and more <hi>Southerly,</hi> are ſubject unto. It being obſerved, that in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the <hi>Northern</hi> parts of <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> &amp;c. their <hi>Cider</hi> far excells their <hi>Wines:</hi> Here in <hi>England</hi> alſo, <hi>Cider</hi> well made of Mature Fruits, not only excells any <hi>Wine</hi> made here, but the <hi>Wines</hi> that are made in the moſt parts of <hi>France, Germany,</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country on this ſide the 40 degree of Latitude.</p>
               <p>The principal cauſe of the excellency of theſe Liquors above any other prepared Drinks, is, for that this Juice or Sap is not only collected out of the Earth by the ſmall fibrious Roots of the Trees, but exhaled by the attracting power of the Sun, into the Branches and Stalks, thence deſcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fruit, where it is by the continual
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101529:22"/> animating heat of the Sun, maturated. Which natural proceſs of Extraction, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, Concoction, Digeſtion, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation, far exceeds the Art of man to imitate, much leſs to exceed. Wherefore, not without cauſe, may thoſe Liquors be worthily preferred to any other Drinks whatſoever: And more particularly and eſpecially, the Juice of the Apple in theſe more <hi>Northern</hi> Regions, before any other Liquors in what Country ſoever prepared. Not but that thoſe Liquors, in thoſe places where they grow, may be much better than any other produced there: But being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into a more remote Country, and of a different Climate, it begets an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent alteration in the Drink it ſelf; which, together with the great difference that is between the Inhabitants of either Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, very much derogateth from the happy effects that ſuch Liquor might produce, if made uſe of neerer the place of its firſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
               <p>And as the Inhabitants of theſe <hi>European,</hi> and part of the <hi>Aſian</hi> Countries, do affect, and principally eſteem theſe Juices of the <hi>Grape</hi> and <hi>Apple:</hi> ſo they of the more remote parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> put a great value on the Juice of <hi>Coco-nut,</hi> taken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101529:23"/> before it be quite ripe, when it yields a thin, though immature, yet pleaſant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; and when more mature, then a more rich and oyly Repaſt.</p>
               <p>In <hi>America,</hi> no Drink ſo much in eſteem as <hi>Chocolate;</hi> the principal Ingredient whereof is the Nut <hi>Cacao,</hi> which in the vaſt Regions there ſubdued by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> are propagated in ſuch abundance, that the accompt thereof is almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and for no other uſe, than to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into that excellent <hi>Regallo, Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe Wines or Liquors have obtained the pre-eminence above all other Drinks throughout the greateſt part of the known world, yet are there ſeveral ſorts of more inferiour Fruits that yield very pleaſant and wholeſome Drinks (as before may be obſerved) that can never be advanced to that repute or univerſal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, as theſe laſt mentioned; but may nevertheleſs be compared, if not preferred to any other Drinks extracted or prepared from any other Subject than Fruit.</p>
               <p>The Juices of Fruits being Mature, are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101529:23"/> worthily eſteemed to be very grateful to the Stomach, and of eaſie digeſtion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by reaſon of their concoction and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation in the Fruits, become before-hand a <hi>ſemi Sanguis,</hi> or half Blood, and are not ſo ſubject to putrefaction as other Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a meaner Claſſis; which is alſo the reaſon, that with a due ordering of them, by a meer natural Maturation, the moſt of them will keep in their full purity ſeveral months and years; and ſome of them for many years increaſing ſtill in ſtrength, purity, and pleaſantneſs; which no other Extracts are capable of.</p>

               <p>HAving taſted a little of thoſe ſeveral Dainties that are in moſt Countries liquidly prepared to pleaſe the Palate, I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101529:24"/> hope every Engliſh man, or Native of this Iſle, on his return hither, will conclude with me, that our Britiſh Fruits yield us the beſt <hi>Beverages;</hi> and of theſe Fruits, the <hi>Apple</hi> the beſt, which is here called <hi>Cider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Antiquity of this Liquor in this Country, much might be ſaid, if you will grant that the name <hi>Wine</hi> was formerly, as well as lately, uſed as a common name to the Juices of ſeveral other Fruits beſides the <hi>Grape;</hi> there being mention made of ſeveral Vineyards that have antiently been in <hi>England;</hi> as that of <hi>Elie, Dans Vinea Vinum,</hi> a Vineyard yielding Wine; and that of <hi>Bromwell-Abby</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> bearing the names of Vineyards to this day.</p>
               <p>The name <hi>Seider</hi> being <hi>Britiſh,</hi> having ſome Analogy with the Greek word <hi>Sicera,</hi> is alſo an Argument that it was a Drink a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Antient <hi>Britains,</hi> they wanting Names for new things.</p>
               <p>The Tradition that Tythes have been paid for Wines made of certain Vineyards in <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire:</hi> And <hi>Camdens</hi> teſtimony that there was no County in all <hi>England</hi> ſo thick ſet with Vineyards as <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire,</hi> nor ſo plentiful in increaſe; the Wines made thereof not affecting their mouths that drank them with an unpleaſant tartneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:101529:24"/> and adds that to be the reaſon why many places in that Country, and elſewhere in <hi>England,</hi> are called Vineyards: All theſe Teſtimonies may be as well for the planting of Orchards for <hi>Cider,</hi> as Vineyards for <hi>Wine;</hi> the name <hi>Wine</hi> might be then uſed for that Liquor, as now for other: and the preference they then gave to the Wines of <hi>Glouceſter-ſhire</hi> before other, in not being ſo tart, is a good Argument that it was ſo, becauſe the <hi>Spontaneous trees</hi> or <hi>Wildings</hi> of that Country might very well yield a better Drink then, than the Apples for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly planted in the Orchards of other parts of <hi>England;</hi> it being but of late years that pleaſant Fruit, or good <hi>Cider-</hi>Fruit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have been propagated in moſt parts of this Country; and in ſome places not any to this day.</p>
               <p>The name of <hi>Cider</hi> from <hi>Sicera</hi> being but a general name for an inebriating or an intoxicating Drink, may argue their ignorance in thoſe times of any other name than <hi>Wine</hi> for that Liquor or Juice; it being as proper for the Juice of the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> as the <hi>Grape,</hi> if it be derived either from <hi>Vi</hi> or <hi>Vincendo,</hi> or <hi>quaſi Divinum,</hi> as one would have it.</p>
               <p>Alſo the vulgar Tradition of the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101529:25"/> of forreign Wines in <hi>England, viz.</hi> that <hi>Sack</hi> which then was imported for the moſt part but from <hi>Spain,</hi> was ſold in the Apothecaries Shops as a Cordial Medicine; and the vaſt increaſe of Vineyards in <hi>France, (A'e</hi> and <hi>Beer</hi> being uſual Drinks in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time) is an Argument ſufficient that the name of <hi>Wine-Vineyards</hi> might be attributed to our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Wine-Cider,</hi> and to the places ſeparated for the propagating the Fruit that yields it.</p>

               <head>SECT. II. Cider <hi>preſerred to forreign Wines.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Whether it be from the greater degree of concoction in the Juice of the <hi>Apple,</hi> being thinner diſperſed in the body of the Fruit, than that is which is in the <hi>Grape,</hi> or whether it be becauſe the greateſt part of the Wines uſually imported from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, are not of their beſt extraction, or impaired by tranſportation; the well-made <hi>Cider</hi> of ſome parts of <hi>England</hi> is to be preferred by the moſt indifferent and unprejudiced Palates: as the moſt acute <hi>John Evelin</hi> Esq; in the Preface to his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> hath diverſly illuſtrated, eſpecially
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101529:25"/> by that Preſident of the Challenge of Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> with the London-Vintner, where the <hi>Redſtreak-Cider</hi> gained the Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Vintners beſt <hi>Spaniſh</hi> or <hi>French Wine,</hi> by variety of judges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wine</hi> of the <hi>Grape,</hi> although of it ſelf, <note place="margin">More wholeſome.</note> being well made and preſerved, without thoſe too common <hi>Sopiſtications, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, Brewings,</hi> or <hi>Compoſitions,</hi> is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt an excellent Cordial, and taken moderately, much conducing to health and long life: yet the conſtant uſe of it as a quotidian Drink, Experience hath taught us, that it is very injurious to the Drinker. If it be new, that is to ſay, under the age of a year, or be ſet into a new fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the addition of new <hi>Wine</hi> or <hi>Stum,</hi> it purges, and puts the blood into a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that it indangers the health of him that drinks it, and ſometimes his life. If it be old <hi>Wine,</hi> which is commonly the beſt, then the Vintners cunning in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, and making it palatable by his ſecret and concealed Mixtures, renders it dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be drank either faſting, or in great quantity; many having died ſuddenly meerly by drinking of ſuch Wine: For there is no Drink more homogeneal to the bloud than <hi>Wine,</hi> the Spirit thereof being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101529:26"/> the beſt Vehicle of any Medicine to the moſt remote parts that the bloud circulates in: therefore if any evil mixture be in it, the more it operates, and is ſooneſt convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the heart and all other parts of the body.</p>
               <p>It is recorded by <hi>Pliny,</hi> That <hi>Androcydes</hi> a noble, ſage, and wiſe Philoſopher, wrote unto <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, to correct and reform his intemperate drinking of Wine, whereto he was very prone, and in his fits of Drunkenneſs very rude; the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate drinking whereof is by him affirmed to be very dangerous and pernicious.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Cider,</hi> that we have had the long and conſtant experience of the making of it, and preſerving it for ſeveral years in its true and genuine taſte; <hi>Cider</hi> of two and three years old being not unuſual in the Cider-Countries, the late Lord <hi>Scudamore</hi> having had a Repoſitory on purpoſe to preſerve it in, at his Seat in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and that without any Sophiſtication or Adulteration, but by the onely Art of right preparing and ordering of it.</p>
               <p>The conſtant uſe of this Liquor, either ſimple or diluted, hath been found by long experience to avail much to health and long life; preſerving the Drinkers of it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101529:26"/> in their full ſtrength and vigour even to very old Age; witneſs that famous Hiſtory in my <hi>Lord Bacon</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory of Life and Death,</hi> of eight men that but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time danced a <hi>Morris-dance,</hi> whoſe Age computed together made eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years; for what ſome wanted of one hundred years, others exceeded. Theſe were reported to be Tenants of one Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, belonging to the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at that time, and to be conſtant Cider-drinkers. And divers other Preſidents of the like nature, <hi>Herefordſhire, Glouceſterſhire,</hi> &amp;c. can furniſh you withal.</p>
               <p>If it be new and unfermented, it preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceth not the Drinker; nor if it be old, ſo that it's unpleaſantneſs forbids you not to drink it, but for its unpleaſantneſs ſake.</p>
               <p>Its agreeing with our natures, adds much to its Salubrity, becauſe of its innocency, it yielding alſo a good Spirit, which may probably prove a Vehicle anſwerable to that of other Wine: At leaſt it may make a very good <hi>Brandy,</hi> which (when the Fruit is grown more common) in plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful years may be experimented and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Although there is no <hi>Liquor, Drink,</hi> nor <note place="margin">More Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</note> 
                  <hi>Diet</hi> alike pleaſant to all, ſome preferring

               <p>The <hi>Apple</hi> it ſelf, which is but one kinde of Fruit, yet are there ſeveral ſorts of them that delight in ſome places, and will not thrive in another: which made the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh-men</hi> ſo addict themſelves to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the <hi>Pippin</hi> and <hi>Codlin,</hi> becauſe no other Apple would proſper ſo well in that County; which gave them the names of <hi>Kentiſh-Pippin</hi> and <hi>Codlin;</hi> when in ſome other places neither of thoſe Fruits will proſper without Art, but are deſtroyed by that pernicious Diſeaſe the Canker. The <hi>Redſtreak</hi> alſo is obſerved to proſper bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and yield a better Juice in ſome places than in other, although but in the next Pariſh.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be obſerved in Pears:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101529:29"/> Summer-Pears will thrive where Winter-Pears will not. Which is the firſt thing to be conſidered of, to wit, what Species of Fruits are moſt natural to the Country or place where you intend to raiſe your Trees; which may be known partly by obſervation of the growth of Trees in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and (where that ſatisfies not) by experimenting variety of ſorts in your Ground. And when you have reſolved what Species to propagate, then ſelect or ſet out your Ground.</p>
               <p>For the diſtinguiſhing whereof, there <note place="margin">What ſort of Land best.</note> are many Rules; but he that is ſeated or fixed in any place, and cannot convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly change his Habitation, muſt be content with his own: and if any defect or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage be in it, it may be it hath ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that another wants. If it lie to the <hi>North,</hi> the Trees bud and blow the later, and many times the Fruit ſucceeds the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and is the freer from the injurious <hi>South-</hi>winds in the Autumnal Seaſon. If it lie to the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> it hath not onely the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being later budden and blown, becauſe of the cold <hi>Eaſterly-winds</hi> in the Spring; but the Fruit ripens the better, the Morning-Sun in the Summer being by much the beſt; and the Fruits are alſo freed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101529:29"/> from the <hi>Weſtern-winds,</hi> which with the <hi>South</hi> are the worſt. If your Land be on a dry or riſing ground, you may plant them the thicker, which will cover and ſhade the ground the ſooner, and make them bear the better: the Fruit will alſo yield a more Vinous Liquor. If your Ground lie in a cold moiſt Vale, the ſooner may you raiſe a natural Fence or ſecurity about it, to defend your Trees from cold Winds and ſtiff Guſts, which diverſly annoy your Trees and Fruits. The worſe your Land is, the more you have for your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; the better it is, the leſs charge to plant it, and the ſooner will you reap the benefit of your labour.</p>
               <p>But if you have the liberty to chuſe what Land you will for planting of Fruit-trees, then for the <hi>Cider-Fruit</hi> chuſe a good warm light Rye-land: for the heavier, colder, and moiſter Wheat-land is not ſo good, the <hi>Cider</hi> being not ſo cleer nor Vinous.</p>
               <p>If the Ground be very light and rich of it ſelf, or ſo made by improvement, ſeveral ſorts of Apple-trees, eſpecially the <hi>Pippin,</hi> will be ſo apt to the Canker, that they will ſcarce ever be large Trees: Therefore a firm and ſtrong Land is beſt for Winter or longlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Fruit;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101529:30"/> but for the ordinary <hi>Cider</hi> or Summer-Fruit, Land cannot be too light: The more it inclines to redneſs, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>If the Ground be too hot, dry, ſhallow, <note place="margin">Amendment of Land.</note> or barren, raiſe the land on broad Ridges, that the middle of them may be about twenty or thirty foot diſtance, according as you intend to plant your Trees: Let the Intervals between the Ridges be about ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight foot broad, or more, and the Earth taken up between about a foot deep caſt on the Ridges, which will make the ground thicker than before it was, and your Trees you may plant deeper in it than otherwiſe you could do; where they will thrive very well, as may be perceived on the Banks of ſome land in the Hedges, that Apple-trees will thrive better than in the level land.</p>
               <p>If water cannot be obtained to moiſten it ſometimes, by ſmall Rivulets running through it, which will highly advance the growth and fertility of your Fruit-trees; Chalk, Marle, or Clay laid and ſpread on the ſurface of it, will cool and ſadden it, and make the ground very rich, and yield a good Graſs, under which the Roots of the Trees will ſpread with delight.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:101529:30"/>
               <p> Fern or any other Vegetable, nay Stones covering ſuch Land, will preſerve it cool and moiſt in the Summer, as well as warm in the Winter.</p>
               <p>If the ground be cold, moiſt, and ſpewy, endeavour what you can to drain it, either by open Trenches or cloſe, which are made after this manner. Dig ſeveral narrow Trenches, one between each row of Trees, deſcending to ſome Ditch at the lower end of your Ground, and lay in the bottom of it Alder, Frith, or Faggots (ſome ſay Beech will laſt as long) and fill the Trenches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the ſaid Frith or Faggots, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel your Ground as before; by which means the water will inſinuatingly paſs through the ſaid wood to the lower ſide of your ground, leaving the reſt the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: But if you cannot conveniently do this, then raiſe it as before is directed for your dry land.</p>
               <p>For the mixture or compoſition, any Dung or ſandy Soil is very good, ſo that the Dung, whilſt new, come not too neer the roots of your Trees.</p>
               <p>But if your Ground be of a cold Clay, or ſtrong ſtiff nature, then the beſt way is to caſt it up as before, tempering it with Sand, or ſandy compoſt, any ſort of Dung,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101529:31"/> or rotten Vegetables; and to plant it with the moſt hard Apples, <hi>Pippins,</hi> &amp;c. and keep the ground annually plowed or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the very ſtem of the Tree, which will be a means to preſerve the Trees from Moſs, which Trees in this ſort of ground are naturally ſubject unto.</p>
               <p>If Land be ſubject to be overflown by the ſwelling of Rivers, or other falls of water, it often proves very good for Fruit, ſo that it be drained again, and the water not ſuffered to ſtand too long on it, and the Land not of a cold ſtiff nature.</p>
               <p>If your Land decline a little towards <note place="margin">Poſition or Scituation of Land to be planted.</note> the <hi>South-East,</hi> it is eſteemed the beſt Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of Land to plant Fruit-trees on: Firſt, By reaſon that in the Spring, <hi>Eaſterly-winds</hi> keep back or check the Bud. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, For that it hath the benefit of the whole <hi>Anti-Meridian</hi> Sun, which is eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the beſt in the Summer and Autumn, diſperſing the cold Dews early from the chill Fruits; the Air being warm'd by the Sun all the day, is ſufficient in the evening to preſerve and continue the ſame heat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sun-beams. Thirdly, It hath ſome advantage by this Poſition from the Winds in the Autumn, that blow from the <hi>South-Weſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> uſually prejudicial, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101529:31"/> ſometimes deſtructive to the Fruits.</p>
               <p>If you plant your Fruit-trees in your <note place="margin">Fencing or ſheltring of land.</note> Hedge-rows, or <hi>ſparſim</hi> here and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your Land, your onely care will be to fence and preſerve each Tree from the wrong or injury it may ſuſtain by Cattle, unleſs you graft on ſtocks that are already nurſed up in the Hedges, naturally defended thereby from ſpoil; but if in open places care muſt be taken to Buſh them, ſo that Cattle may not rub againſt them, nor crop them.</p>
               <p>If you make a Plantation any where by it ſelf, if it be not otherwiſe defended by Hills or Trees, you may at the ſame time as you plant your Fruit, plant other Trees on the confines of your Plantation. If your Ground be moiſt, then may you plant <hi>Poplar</hi> or any other of the taller ſort of Aquaticks: If a dry Land, then <hi>Wallnuts, Aſh,</hi> or any Tree that delights on dry land. For ſuch defence preſerves your Trees from blighting Blaſts in the Spring, and deſtructive Winds in the Summer and Autumn.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time alſo when you plant your Fruit-trees, it will much conduce to the preſervation of them when Mature, if you plant a good Quick-hedge of <hi>White-thorn,</hi> which will be a very good Fence
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101529:32"/> by the time that the Fruit-trees come to bear, ſufficient to keep out the Cattle from cropping the tender Twigs of your Fruit-trees, and rubbing againſt their Stems; and unruly people from deſtroying the Fruit.</p>

               </head>
               <p>To obtain as well good Trees as good Fruits, is a great care. Some pretend to raiſe excellent Fruits from the Kernel of the Apple, which rather carrieth with it the nature of the Stalk the Tree was graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on, than the Fruit it proceeded from therefore I ſhall take little notice of it here. Although many have pretended to have raiſed ſome new Species of Fruits by this means, Grafting being by all, as well our Modern Planters as the Antient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be the beſt and moſt expeditious way to preſerve the right Species of Fruits, and accelerate their bearing. The choice of the Stock is therefore to be conſidered; which moſt agree the <hi>Crab-ſtock</hi> to be the beſt, although many affirm that the <hi>Wilding-ſtock,</hi> or of the <hi>Paradiſe-Apple,</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: for a Tree grafted on a <hi>Crab-ſtock</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101529:32"/> is of longer duration than any other, the wood being more hard, and leſs ſubject to decay, and the Root more naturally ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in our Soil than any other. It alſo not onely preſerves, but quickens and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livens the Guſt of any delicate Apple.</p>
               <p>But if the Apple you intend to Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate be over-tart, then ſweeten it on a <hi>Gennet-Moyle</hi> or <hi>Wilding-ſtock,</hi> rather than on a <hi>Crab-ſtock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you are reſolved on what Stocks <note place="margin">Raiſing of Stocks.</note> you intend to graft, then provide your ſelf with the Chaff or <hi>Murc</hi> of that Fruit you derive your Stock from, and ſpread it thin over a Bed of Earth dig'd, dreſſed, and cleanſed from Weeds; and ſpread or ſift Earth two or three fingers thick lightly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, that it may be all covered; and ſo let it lie all the Winter, and in the Spring following you will have plenty of young Stocks appear promiſcuouſly. During the Summer, keep them weeded clean, and the Winter following draw them where they are too thick or irregular, and tranſplant them into other Beds well dreſſed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and there let them ſtand until they are big enough to graft.</p>
               <p>Or you may obtain <hi>Crab-ſtocks</hi> out of the Woods and Hedge-rows, and plant

               <p>The <hi>Crab-ſtock</hi> alſo thrives beſt when removed from a cold and dry Hilly-land, to a warm and fertile Soil; but thoſe rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Seed are the beſt.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that the Stocks raiſed of Seed or Kernels emit a downright Root into the ground, called a <hi>Tap-root,</hi> which in the removal of your young Stocks, ought to be taken away; then will the Roots of your Stocks ſpread, which will make them the eaſier to be removed, when they are grafted and fit for tranſplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>Before you cut your Grafts, conſider <note place="margin">Choice of Fruits.</note> what Fruits you are moſt inclinable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate. But ſeeing that my intentions are onely to treat of Drinks, I ſhall onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here ſuch Apples that are proper for <hi>Cider,</hi> although otherwiſe uſeful, and to be preferred, in ſome caſes, before the other ſorts that are leſs apt for the Mill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cider-</hi>fruit may be divided into three parts: Firſt, Such that are for making ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Cider,</hi> or for the preſent drinking.

Thirdly, Such that are uſeful Fruit for the Table, yet making a very pleaſant and acceptable <hi>Cider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt Claſſis, the <hi>Codlin</hi> is the <note place="margin">Cod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101529:35"/> by which means they will proſper very well, and ſoon become Trees; but theſe are more ſubject to the Canker than thoſe that are grafted.</p>
               <p>Theſe, of all the ſorts of Apple-trees, agree beſt in a neer Neighbourhood of their own Species; for ſet them as cloſe as you will, they will thrive, and bear very well: therefore are they fit to plant in Rows, Walks, and Avenues, and make a very graceful and pleaſant proſpect.</p>
               <p>It is uſual with ſome to plaſh them to Poles, to make a Palliſade-hedge with them; which is not commendable, becauſe they are pithy Trees, and ill endure to be lopt, thriving beſt when permitted to ſhoot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and bear the more. They delight alſo in ſhady Groves or Walks.</p>
               <p>The next is the <hi>Gennet-Moyle,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights <note place="margin">Gennet-Moyle.</note> moſt to grow ſingle from its Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but as for its being grafted or growing of Sets, it is very much like the <hi>Codlin.</hi> This Fruit makes by far the better <hi>Cider,</hi> and is for preſent drinking, and almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals the beſt of <hi>Ciders.</hi>

               <p>Of the ſecond Claſſis, is the <hi>Redſtreak,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Redſtreak.</note> which is now the moſt univerſally celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for its Juice, of any Apple this Iſland yields: It is one of the ſorts of <hi>Wildings</hi> of <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and for the excellency of its Liquor, is now ſpread into moſt parts of <hi>England.</hi> There are ſeveral ſorts of them, the one more red than the other, and is called the <hi>Red-Redſtreak;</hi> another there is that is more pleaſing to the Palate than the former.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Redſtreak</hi> is to be preferred for your Plantation to any other Apple what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, eſpecially remote from your houſe. Firſt, Becauſe it yields the beſt of <hi>Britiſh</hi> drinks. Secondly, Becauſe the Fruit is harſh and unpleaſant, not tempting the Palates of lewd perſons. Thirdly, The Tree thrives in as mean Land as any other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whatſoever, being a ſpontaneous Plant at firſt. Fourthly, It's a conſtant bearer, being a <hi>Wilding,</hi> enduring (more than the greater part of other Fruit) the ſeverity of the ſharp Springs, ſometimes deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to thoſe that are more tender. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Tree bears in a few years after its grafting, recompencing betimes the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and coſt of the Planter; the delay
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101529:36"/> whereof in other Fruits, having been a principal obſtacle to the great deſigne of Planting. Sixthly, The Tree is low and humble, and ſo more of them may be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a like quantity of Land, than the taller Trees, which ſhade the ground more. Seventhly, The lowneſs of the Trees pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the ſharp winds in the Spring, and the Fruit of them are not ſo apt to be blown off in the Autumn. Eighthly, This Fruit exceeds all other Apples in the Kitchin, for the time they laſt.</p>

               <p>As for the ſize, let them be but ſhort, with two or three Eyes or Buds at moſt, and thoſe the neerer together, the better. Grafts are uſually cut a little below the Knot or Joynt of the laſt years growth, becauſe the wood is there hard, and the rind thick, to ſhoulder well on the Stock;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101529:37"/> but the ſmalleſt top will grow, though of the laſt years growth onely: yet the Grafts of two or three years growth cut ſhort (&amp; the Buds that are likely to blow broken off) are beſt on large and well-rooted Stocks, where they make the beſt ſhoots, and are not ſo eaſily ſubject to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of the more ſlender.</p>
               <p>When once the Leaf is wholly off, and <note place="margin">To keep Grafts.</note> before the Tree begins again to bud, Grafts then cut, may be kept until the Spring or Grafting-time, the ends being ſtuck in the ground, and tranſported or carried to any remote place: If the ends be ſtuck in Clay, or in a Turnip, or they bound up in green Moſs, or being wrapped in oyl'd or waxen Leather, the intent being to keep them cool, and from the exſiccating winds; for in froſty and windy weather, Trees ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up and not yet planted, being laid in a Cellar, or ſuch-like place, are preſerved, when otherwiſe expoſed to the wind, though much more cold, are deſtroyed.</p>

               <p>Grafting in the Cleft, is to cut off the <note place="margin">In the Cleft.</note> Stock at a ſmooth place at the height you intend; and if the Stock be ſmall, from one to three inches diameter, then cleave it, that the ſlit may be on the ſmootheſt ſide of the Stock; and fit your Graff, ſhoulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at a Joynt or Bud, joyning the inſide of the Rindes exactly.</p>
               <p>But if the Stock exceed three inches di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, <note place="margin">In the Rind.</note> or thereabouts, the beſt way is to graft in the Rind or Bark, which is done with a Wedge made of Ivory, Box, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard wood, made of a flat half-round form, tapering to a point; and force the ſame in between the Rind and the Stock, until you have made the paſſage wide enough for the Graft, the end whereof muſt be cut after the ſame form with the Rind peel'd off, preſerving on as much of the inner Rind as you can, and making the Graft to ſhoulder well on the Stock. Thus may you ſet many Grafts round the Stock; and the more there are, the ſooner will they cover the Stock.</p>
               <p>If the Stock be under an inch in diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Whip-graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> then the beſt way is to whip on the Grafts, that is to ſay, if the Stock be big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101529:39"/> than the Graft, then cut the Stock off at the ſmootheſt place, and a little ſloping. Some place the Graff to the upper ſide of the Slope, and ſome to the lower, which is the better way, that the Rind or Bark may cover the ſooner: on which ſide ſoever it be, the Rind muſt be pared away, beginning eaſily, and ſo deeper upwards until you cut to the wood at the top; then pare the end of the Graft accordingly, leaving it with a full and broad ſhoulder to reſt on the top of the Stock, and fit it aptly to the Stock, and bind it on with Hemp, Yarn, Baſſe, or ſuch-like: but if the Graft and Stock be neer of a ſize, then cut the Graft aſlope, and the end of the Stock likewiſe, and binde them together Rind to Rind.</p>
               <p>If the Tree and Stock ſtand neer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">By approach.</note> they may be united, by paring away the Rind of both, and binding them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther until they are perfectly joyned; then may you cut away the branch that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led to the Graft, and leave it to extract its nouriſhment from the Stock.</p>
               <p>When your Grafts are placed as they <note place="margin">Luting of Grafts.</note> ought in their Stocks, then muſt you apply good Lute or Clay mixed with new Horſe-dung (without the Straw) and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, to prevent chapping; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101529:39"/> the heads of the Stocks moiſt, that the Rind or Bark may cover them the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and defends them from the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of cold, wet and drought: but if the Stocks be ſmall, a little Soft-wax well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſtered on them, is eaſier done, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them better than the other. Always remember to cut the Ligaments off thoſe Grafts you whipt on, about <hi>Midſommer</hi> following.</p>
               <p>Some of late have attempted to raiſe <note place="margin">New man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of grafting.</note> Nurſeries or Plantations, by whipping the Graff to a piece of a Root of a Tree of the ſame ſpecies, and ſo to plant it in the ground, a little lower than the grafting place, that the Earth may cover the wound, that the Root may feed the Graff, as the Stock doth in the former ways. Thus with the Root of one <hi>Crab-tree</hi> cut in pieces, may you raiſe twenty or thirty <hi>Apple-trees.</hi> And thus may you unite the Graft to a Stock of a different kind, whereby new Fruits may be produced, and the old meliorated; the wound being within the ground, and not obvious to the extreams of the weather. This only is objected, that the Tree grows but ſlowly, moſt affecting expedition in theſe affairs.</p>
               <p>Several ſorts of Fruits are beſt inocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">Inoculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:101529:40"/> ted, and ſome indifferent either way, as <hi>Cherries, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. The time for this work, is from the middle of <hi>June,</hi> to the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> as the ſeaſon of the year is either forward or late.</p>
               <p>The buds you are to chooſe from Shoots of the ſame years growth; which if by carriage in the Air, or otherwiſe, they are a little withered, you may revive them by ſetting them in water, which will make the buds come the cleaner from the wood.</p>
               <p>To prepare the Stock, take the cleaneſt part of the Stock, and cut the Rind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, and from the middle thereof ſlit down the Rind neer an inch in length, that both cuts may reſemble a T: then cut off the ſprig out of which you take your bud a little above it, and about half an inch below it, and ſlit the ſhort piece of the ſprig in your hand in the midſt, leaving the bud on one ſide; then with your Quill in form of a Goudge, beginning above the bud, divide the Rind from the remaining piece of the ſprig, ſo that the bud be firm in the Rind; which take, holding it by the piece of the ſtalk of the leaf which is left uncut off; and after you have opened the place in the ſtock by dividing the Rind from the wood gently and not too deep, place in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101529:40"/> the Bud, and cloſe the Rind of it to the Rind above, and the two lappets of the Rind of the Stock over the Rind of the Bud, and bind it over with Woollen-Yarn. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a month after obſerve whether the Bud (over which the Yarn was not to go) be green or not: if it be, then unbind it, and the next Spring cut off the Stock about an inch above the Bud.</p>
               <p>Alſo the ſlit may be made upwards, and ſothe Rind at the bottom of the Scutcheon or Bud fitted to the Rind of the Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, inſtead of that above: And it may be performed by cutting a ſquare place in the Stock, and fitting into it a ſquare Scutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Bud in it, and binding it cloſe.</p>
               <p>Some ſorts of Fruits may be propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">By Layers or Slips.</note> by Layers or Slips, as the <hi>Codling,</hi> the <hi>Gennet-Moil,</hi> and the <hi>Creeping Apple:</hi> the <hi>Vine, Currant,</hi> and <hi>Gooſeberry,</hi> are alſo propagated by either of theſe ways.</p>
               <p>Several new and good ſpecies of Fruits <note place="margin">By Kernels.</note> have been raiſed by Kernels: but for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, certainty, and advantage, the other are the better ways.</p>

               <p>Having raiſed your Nurſery, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <note place="margin">Tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trees.</note> provided your ſelf of a competent number of Trees, and ſelected your Ground whereon you intend to plant them; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how to diſpoſe of the Trees to your beſt advantage, that is, to plant your tall Standard-Trees in ſuch places where you intend to make uſe of the Land for Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that they may be above the reach of Cattel. But in ſuch places where you can diſpence with the abſence of Cattel, and uſe the Land only for the Sythe or Spade, there it is beſt to plant dwarf or low-grafted Trees, for ſeveral reaſons. 1. You may plant more of them on the like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Land, becauſe the Shadow of the one Tree doth not reach the ground of the other, as that of the tall Trees doth. 2. The low Trees ſooner attain to be Fruit-bearing Trees, and grow fairer than the tall; the Sap in them waſting in its long paſſage, which in the ſhorter Trees expends it ſelf ſoon in the Branches. 3. The low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and broad-ſpreading Tree is the greater bearer, by reaſon the Bloſſoms in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101529:41"/> Spring are not ſo obvious to the bitter blaſts, nor the Fruit in the Autumn to the fiece and deſtructive Winds. 4. Fruit are more eaſily gathered from a low than a tall Tree: beating or ſhaking down Fruit from ſuch Trees, being to be rejected by all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Cyderiſts. 5. Any Fruit on a low well-ſpread Tree, is better and fairer than that on a tall Tree, by the ſame reaſon that the Tree is fairer, that is, that the Sap is not ſo much waſted in the low and humble Tree, as in the tall and lofty.</p>
               <p>Although you may remove a Tree any <note place="margin">Time for planting Trees.</note> time of the year, and yet ſo that it may grow. But if you deſign to remove your Trees that they may proſper well, and that you may chooſe your time; the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſon is at the fall of the Leaf, or when you perceive that the Sap doth no longer aſcend, ſo as to afford nouriſhment to the Leaf; which is uſually about the end of <hi>September:</hi> and ſo you may continue removing all the Month of <hi>October,</hi> and the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> before the more cold weather prevents you: yet if the weather be open, you may remove till the Trees begin to Bud.</p>

               <p>Here alſo note, That in caſe a Tree, as it ſtands before removal, hath the benefit of the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West-Sun</hi> more than of the <hi>South,</hi> then where you plant that Tree,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:101529:42"/> give that ſide, that before had that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, the like again in its new place: which although it varies from the former poſitive directions, yet not from the reaſon of it.</p>
               <q>Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas.</q>
               <p>Having thus marked your Trees, take them up with as large Roots as you can, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the ſpreading Roots.

               <p>In the planting of your Trees, abate the down-right Roots, leaving thoſe that ſpread: for it is obſerved, that the more the Root ſpreads, the more the Branches; tall Trees uſually extending their Roots deepeſt, as <hi>Virgil</hi> obſerved of the <hi>Aeſculus.</hi>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:101529:43"/>
               <p> Of thoſe Roots you leave, prune only the ends by cutting them like unto a Hinds foot on the under-ſide, they will put forth new Roots the better.</p>
               <p>In caſe Trees have lain ſome time out of the ground, or been carried in the wind that their Roots ſeem to be dry, ſet them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-night in water, immerging only the Roots, and it will very much revive them. Or when you plant them, after you have added an indifferent quantity of Earth, caſt in a Pail or more of Water, as the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the foſs requires; which not only quickens the Root, but makes the Earth adhere to the Roots, which otherwiſe would<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly light and hollow about them: the Air much incommoding the Root of any Plant whatever.</p>
               <p>According to the nature of the ground or depth of the Mold, ſo make your hole more or leſs deep wherein you plant your Tree: if it be a cold or ſpringy ground, then plant neer the ſurface of it, and raiſe the Earth at ſome diſtance round the Tree; but in any ground, plant not too deep: for you may obſerve in many Plantations, Trees thrive beſt where the Roots run neer the ſurface, and not at all where planted deep. The Roots of themſelves naturally tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:101529:43"/> either wide or deep, as they find nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although you plant them ſhallow; but if you plant them deep, it's againſt the nature of Roots to tend upwards, although ſometimes it may ſo happen, but rarely.</p>
               <p>It is good to dig the hole or foſs deep and wide, and to fill the bottome with good Mold, either the Turfor paring of Land, or well-tempered Street-dirt, or the ſediment of haſty Currents that ſettle in bottoms of Pools or Ditches, or rotten Vegetables, or burnt Earth, or any thing that will either mend or alter the ground, and that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for your Trees: fill it to ſuch a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient height, that you may plant your Tree on the top of it; and then adde good Mold about the Root, and dilute it with Water, as before is directed. Then level the Earth about the Tree, ſo that it may not be too high to injure the bark of the Tree, and ſo that the water may rather fall towards, than from the Tree.</p>
               <p>If you plant Standards, and in an open place, it is convenient to ſtake them the firſt year, ſo that you be careful to prevent gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, by interpoſing a ſmall wiſp of Hay between the Tree and ſtake, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtake leaning towards the coaſt you expect the greateſt Winds: but the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101529:44"/> the Stakes for ſeveral years, ruines many a good Tree, for the Tree will expect it always after; which weakneſs in a Tree may be remedied by lopping of it, and then let it ſtand without ſtaking, and it will gather greater ſtrength in the ground than before.</p>
               <p>Prune the Heads of ſome ſorts of Trees that have but ſmall Pith, as <hi>Apple-trees, Pear-trees,</hi> &amp;c. when you remove them, to proportion the Branch and Root as neer as you can: but <hi>Wallnut-trees, Cherry-trees, Plum-trees,</hi> &amp;c. that have a large Pith, are not to be top'd, onely ſome of the Side-branches may be taken away.</p>
               <p>Plant all Trees as neer as you can into a better Mold than the place you remove them from; but if you cannot obſerve this, yet mend the Earth in the Foſs wherein you plant your Tree, that it may by degrees be inured to a worſe Soil.</p>
               <p>If you have a deſire to remove a Tree in the Summer-time, that you cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at any other more convenient Seaſon, take of the Earth you digged out of the Foſs you intend to plant your Tree in, and mix and temper it well with an equal part of Cow-dung, and as much Water as will make it into a liquid Pap; fill the Hole al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101529:44"/> with this, and then let the Root of the Tree gently ſink into it; cover it over with dry Earth or Turf: This Tree will proſper very well.</p>
               <p>As for the diſtance of Trees, it ought to be according to the nature of the Tree and Soil. If it be a large ſpreading Tree, and a rich Soil, forty foot is a good diſtance; if a <hi>Redſtreak</hi> or ſuch-like dwarfiſh ſhort-liv'd Tree, twenty foot is enough between them, eſpecially if the ground be but indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
               <p>Always obſerve, that the greater the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the better the Sun meliorates the Fruit; and if the ground be good, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do the Trees thrive; and the poorer or drier the ground is, the Trees being thick, the better they ſhadow it, and the more do the Trees proſper.</p>
               <p>If you deſigne a Plantation of many ſorts of Fruits in one Plot, then may you plant your <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> the farther apart; and between them, or in ſubordinate rows by them, may you plant <hi>Cherry-trees, Plum-trees,</hi> and ſuch-like; and next unto them <hi>Filberds, Currants, Gooſeberries,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that if ever the greater Trees ſpread far, by that time the leſſer may be decayed: if thoſe do not, theſe may be renewed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101529:45"/> that no part of the Plot may be fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>In caſe any Tree happen to decay, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtood long in that place, ſo that its Roots have attracted and exhauſted the ſtrength of the Earth appropriate to that Species of Fruit; In the room of ſuch Trees remember to plant one of another Species, as an <hi>Apple-tree</hi> in the room of a decayed <hi>Cherry, &amp; ſic de caeteris;</hi> by which means the Roots of the latter Tree ſhall finde new matter to maintain their Plant, that was not exhauſted by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; moſt Land being weary in time of one Plant.</p>
               <p>After your Trees are planted, if you <note place="margin">Of Pruning Trees.</note> deſigne them for dwarf or ſpreading Trees, then as they ſpring, and are apt to mount upwards, with the Nails of your fingers may you nip off the tops of the aſpiring Branches; which makes the ſide-boughs ſpread the better, checks the Sap, and thereby cauſes the Tree to Fructifie the ſooner, and the better. This way of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Summer, is eaſier and better for the Tree than in the Winter, becauſe the Sun heals the wound whiles the Branch is tender.</p>
               <p>In pruning Fruit-trees, be cautious of cutting off the ſmall Sprigs, which are the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101529:45"/> more apt to bear Fruit; it being too uſual for ignorant Planters to beautifie their Trees by taking off theſe ſuperfluous Branches, as they term them, whereby they deprive themſelves of the Fruit.</p>
               <p>After your Trees are planted and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it's good to keep the ground open about them, by digging or plowing it year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which conduceth much to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the growth of them, and their preſervation from Moſs and other Diſeaſes. This is a Winter-work: anſwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that, in the Summer may you ſpread Fearn or other Vegetables about them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially whilſt they are young; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves their Roots cool and moiſt: both which ought to be done at a good diſtance from the Trunk; it being a vulgar errour to dig or ſoil neer the Tree onely, the former being of little effect, the latter injuring the Bark; for the Roots that gather nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and feed the Tree, are thoſe that are fibrous and remote, ſeeking new and freſh nouriſhment, the greater being onely for conveyance of it to the Trunk.</p>

               <p>The firſt Pruning is to be in <hi>December</hi> or <hi>January</hi> next after your planting; at which time you muſt cut off all the young Shoots cloſe to the old Set, except only one, which you muſt leave, and which ſhould alſo be the ſtrongeſt and moſt likely to proſper; and to that likewiſe ſhould you leave but two or three Knots or Joynts.</p>
               <p>In <hi>May</hi> following, when the Vine buds, then rub off all the young Shoots or Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſave only ſuch that come forth of the Joynts of the young Wood you left in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary;</hi> and continue your <hi>Hawing,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your Vineyard free from Weeds, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill freſh Earth to your Plants as you paſs by them.</p>
               <p>In the Winter following, Prune your Vineyard as you did the laſt, leaving ſtill the beſt Branch or Shoot to each Plant, and about three or four Joynts or Knots. This ſecond Winter dig your Vineyard, and lay it all level, being careful that you touch not any of the main Roots of your Vines with your Spade.</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:101529:48"/>
               <p> In this third Summer; your Vines will <note place="margin">Propping of Vines.</note> begin to bear; to which end you muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Props of <hi>Hazel, Aſh,</hi> or <hi>Oak,</hi> about four Foot in length, placed behind your Plant.</p>
               <p>In <hi>May</hi> rub off all the Suckers, leaving only ſuch as proceed from the Knots of the laſt year, and that are likely to bear Fruit. Then thoſe Shoots that come from thoſe Knots, bind to your Props; and when the Fruit is of about the ſize of <hi>Raddiſh-Seed,</hi> nip off the Branches about a ſpan above it with your Fingers, which is much better than to cut them.

               <p>The fourth year obſerve the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, for then may you expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat fruit of your labour; remembring that in every Winter you leave but one, and that the ſtrongeſt Shoot or Branch for a Standard, and not above four or five Foot high, cutting all the reſt cloſe, unleſs you find any that are very ſtrong, to which you may leave three or four Knots or Joynts, that the Branches that proceed from them (at leaſt the ſtrongeſt) may ſerve for Standards for the enſuing year.

               <p>Remember yearly to cut off the old, and advance the new Shoots, and to tie them to the Props about half way from the Ground; and then turn the top of your Vine to the next Prop, and tie it to that, and ſo ſucceſſively, which will reſemble a Row of Arches.</p>
               <p>As you find your Ground to degenerate <note place="margin">Of Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or Dunging the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</note> and grow poor, which moſt hot Land is apt to do, you muſt ſupply it with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, which muſt be good rotten Dung, and mixt with Lime if you can, laid and ſpread over your Vineyard, that it may lie all the Winter, that the Vertue of it may be waſhed into the Earth to the Roots of your Vines; and then dig it in in the Spring, when you dig your Vineyard; but by no means let not any new Dung
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101529:49"/> come near your Vines, which will too much dry up and burn your Land, and is injurious to all Fruit-bearing Trees, as we before obſerved: which labours of raiſing young Branches from the old Roots, and renewing and amending the Mold by ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration, reiterate and continue for many years. <note place="margin">Of pruning the Vine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Wall.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Many perſons have opportunities to plant Vines againſt Walls, Houſes, Barns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will not only bear much more of Fruit, but more early ripe, having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantages above the open Vineyard. For the pruning of which Trees, obſerve, that on every Sprig you cut off in your Winter-pruning, where you would have Fruit the ſucceeding year, you leave two or three Buds: for out of thoſe Buds, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſecond or third, proceeds the Cluſters. Alſo obſerve to cut off the Branch aſloap on one ſide, or under, that the Rain reſt not on the Pith of the remaining part of the Branch; the Rain oftentimes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the Pith to the lowermoſt Bud. And forget not to leave every year ſome new Branches or Shoots, and to cut off ſome of the old: renovation of the Branches being in this Tree very neceſſary, eſpecially if it be old.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:101529:50"/>

               <p>Vegetables, as well as Animals, have their Diſeaſes and Infirmities, which not only weaken, but totally deſtroy them; which more uſually aſſault the Fruit-bearing Trees more than any other; and the finer and better any Fruit is, the more is its Tree ſubject to theſe Diſeaſes and Infirmities; The chief whereof is the <hi>Canker,</hi> which <note place="margin">The Canker.</note> aſſaulteth the beſt Fruit-trees, as of Apples the <hi>Pippin, Golden Rennet,</hi> &amp;c. of Pears the <hi>Wardens</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Burgamet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cherries</hi> and <hi>Apricocks,</hi> penetrating the midſt of the Branches, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the whole Tree. This Diſeaſe happens from ſeveral cauſes, as from the twiſting or bruiſing a Branch or Limb
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101529:51"/> (which uſually happens in Wall-trees, by plying them to the Wall) and ſomewhat reſembles the Windſhake in an Oak; the cure whereof is to cut off ſuch Branch: alſo galling the one Limb againſt another, which you may prevent by pruning, and cure by cutting off the parts affected. But that Canker is the moſt inveterate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, that proceeds from the Soil; as either being too rich,

                     </l>
                     <l>So too rich Soil deſtroys the tender Plant,</l>
                  </q> which if you know not how to ſterilize, then obſerve what ſorts of Fruit are free from that Diſeaſe in that ground, (for all ſorts of Fruit-trees are not ſubject to it in any ground whatſoever) and propagate them onely.</p>
               <p>Or by being too light; for Trees plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on heavie or ſad Land, are not ſo prone to this Diſeaſe, as in light and warm Land; which may be corrected by abating much of the Earth about the Roots of the Trees, and applying cold, ſad, and heavie dirt or ſettlings in Ponds about them, and by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the cankered Branches. This by Experience hath cured cankered Trees,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:101529:52"/> and may as well prevent the Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The raiſing of Stocks from <hi>Crab-kernels</hi> in the ſame Land, and grafting on them, is a good prevention of this Diſeaſe; for this Stock doth better digeſt the ſweet and luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Juice that cauſes this Diſeaſe, than the ſoft and ſpungy <hi>Apple-ſtock;</hi> to whom alſo the Juice is more homogeneal, than to a ſtranger, removed into it out of a more barren Soil. Vain therefore are all the Cuttings, Parings, Slicings, Emplaiſtrings, and Applications that are voluminouſly preſcribed for the cure of this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>From the Stock uſually ſpring many <note place="margin">Suckers.</note> Suckers, which extract too much nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Tree; which muſt be taken off dextrouſly from the Root, and may be prevented by grafting on good Stocks raiſed from Kernels; for Trees proceeding from Suckers, are always ſubject to this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>If Trees are Bark-bound, it either ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <note place="margin">Bark-bound.</note> that the ground is hard and bound about the Roots of them, or that they are planted too deep: The remedy then is known onely with this addition; That you may ſlit the Bark down with your Knife, about the Spring-time.</p>

               <p>AFter you have thus brought your Plantation to perfection, that you can gather Fruit enough of your own to make <hi>Cider</hi> or other Liquors, according to the nature of the Fruit; the firſt thing to be conſidered of, is its Maturity; there being <note place="margin">Of the ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fruit.</note> much <hi>Cider</hi> ſpoiled in moſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> through that one general errour of gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fruit before its due Maturity. For there is ſcarce any Fruit in the world, but yields very different Liquors, according to the different degrees of Maturity of the ſame Fruit. As the Juice of the <hi>Coco-nut</hi> whilſt green, is a pleaſant thin Drink, but when through ripe, becomes a rich Oyl or Milk: So the Juice of our <hi>European</hi> Fruits which, when moſt mature, yields a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101529:53"/> Drink; if preſſed before, yield but a crude and ſowre Liquor.</p>
               <p>This errour or neglect (occaſioned part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the ſeveral ſorts of Apples ripen not at the ſame time, or that the Wind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents their hanging long enough on the Trees, or the groſs ignorance of the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, or his covetouſneſs of having more Liquor than otherwiſe he ſhould expect) hath not onely been the occaſion of much thin, raw, phlegmatick, ſowre, and unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Cider,</hi> but hath caſt a reflection on the good report that <hi>Cider</hi> well made moſt rightly deſerves.</p>
               <p>Therefore, in caſe your Fruit be not ripe all at one time, ſelect ſuch ſorts that are of a like degree of Maturity, and according to the quantity of them, and ſo propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion your Veſſels; and you were better make it at ſeveral times, than ſpoil your whole Vintage.</p>
               <p>Or if the Winds ſhould beat down many of your Apples, and you are unwilling to ſpoil or looſe them, you may let them lie dry as long as you can before you grinde them, that they may obtain as great a degree of Maturity as they can; and let that <hi>Cider</hi> be throughly fermented before it be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel'd, according to the Rules hereafter ſet
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101529:54"/> down, and not kept too long, to acquire too much acidity.</p>
               <p>Let not any think that they advantage themſelves any thing by mixing unripe with ripe Fruit, or by grinding their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples too ſoon; for they were better looſe a part of their <hi>Cider,</hi> than ſpoil the whole.</p>
               <p>To prevent which ill effect, let your Fruit be through ripe; which is known, Firſt, By the colour of them, if you are acquainted therewith, elſe that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you; ſome Apples appearing brighter before they are ripe, than others when full ripe: the ſame may be obſerved in <hi>Pears,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Cherries;</hi> ſome ſorts requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring twelve or fourteen days throughly to maturate them after they ſeem to be as ripe as the ordinary <hi>Flanders.</hi> Secondly, By the ſmell, moſt <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> caſting a fragrant Odour when ripe, and is a very good ſigne of their maturity, although ſome <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> have but little ſmell; but ſuch for this purpoſe are to be rejected. Thirdly, By the blackneſs of their Kernels, which when they are of that colour, it doth ſignifie that the Fruit is inclining to be ripe; for after the Kernels are black, the Fruit ought to hang on the Trees ſome time to perfect their Maturity; the Liquor
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:101529:54"/> within them being better digeſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by the vertue of the Sun on the Tree, than by any Artifice whatſoever after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, be cautious of letting Fruit hang on the Trees too long, leſt they grow pulpy, which ſome Summer<hi>-Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears</hi> are apt to do: it ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites the Juice with the fleſhy part of the Fruit, that it is difficult to ſeparate the one from the other.</p>
               <p>When your Fruits are in a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Gathering of Fruit.</note> as to Maturity, and the weather fair, then gather them by hand; which if your ſtock be not greater than your number of hands, is a much better way than to beat or ſhake them down; but if your ſtock ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, then ſhake them down, ſo that the ground be dry. For this purpoſe low Trees are to be prefer'd, as before was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>If any of your Fruit happen to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, lay them by themſelves, an ordinary bruiſe not much injuring the Fruit; but where the ſkin is broken, the Spirits exhale, for the bruiſe begets a fermentation, after which the Spirits firſt riſe, being, where the ſkin is whole, detained.</p>
               <p>In ſome parts of <hi>England</hi> their ignorance,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101529:55"/> or rather lazineſs, is ſuch, that they ſcarce beſtow the gathering of their Fruit to keep for their Table; how then can you expect their care for <hi>Cider?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some do prefer the grinding of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <note place="margin">Hoarding of Apples.</note> immediately from the Tree, ſo ſoon as they are throughly ripe, becauſe they yield the greater quantity of Liquor: They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pretend, though erroneouſly, that the <hi>Cider</hi> will drink the better, and laſt longer than if the Apples were hoarded.</p>
               <p>But if you intend to have your <hi>Cider</hi> pleaſant and laſting, let them lie ſome time in a heap out of the Sun and Rain, and on a dry floor, on dry Rye, Wheat, or Oaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraw is beſt, until they have either ſweat out, or digeſted a certain crude Phlegmatick humour that is in moſt of our Fruits: the ſame you may obſerve in Nuts and all ſorts of Grain. The time for this, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to your diſcretion; ſome preſcribing a month or ſix weeks, others but a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: Be ſure not to let them lie too long leſt they grow pulpy, which will very much incommode your <hi>Cider,</hi> although ſome are of another opinion; <hi>In medio virtus:</hi> from ten to twenty days are the beſt times: the harſher the Fruit, the longer the time.</p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:101529:55"/>
               <p> Let them not lie on a Floor of ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, nor on Deal-boards, but with Straw under them, leſt they contract an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, which an Apple will do in a ſweat: nor let them lie abroad, as ſome will do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept on dry ground, and in dry weather, and covered. Although Rain can do them no more hurt than fair Water mixt with the <hi>Cider,</hi> yet every ſort of Apple will not bear it.</p>
               <p>For, from the due time, place and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of hoarding of the Fruit, is oftentimes the <hi>Cider</hi> very good, which otherwiſe might have proved very bad.</p>
               <p>By hoarding only of your Windfalls for ſome time, or until the time that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould have been Ripe in, doth very much meliorate the <hi>Cider</hi> made of them, which otherwiſe might have been very bad.</p>
               <p>Thus when your Fruit is duely ripe, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and preſerved, it is ready for the Mill.</p>

               </head>
               <p>One great impediment in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this moſt excellent drink, hath been the want of a convenient way of grinding or bruiſing the Fruit. It having been the uſage or cuſtome in moſt places of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where but ſmall quantities of this Liquor hath been made, for the Operators to beat their Fruit in a Trough of Wood or Stone, with Beaters like unto Wooden Peſtles, with long handles. By which means three or four Servants or Labourers might in a days time beat twenty or thirty Buſhels of Apples: ſome part thereof into a Jelly, being often under the Beaters, whilſt other part of the Fruit by its ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs eſcapes the Beaters; much of it alſo by daſhing being waſted: yet by this means are made very great quantities of <hi>Cider</hi> in ſeveral places.</p>
               <p>But where the Fruit increaſed, that this way became too tedious for the <hi>Cideriſt,</hi> the Horſe-Mill was and is ſtill much in uſe, Grinding for the whole Pariſh: That is, by placing a large Circular Stone on edge in a round Trough, made alſo of Stone,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:101529:56"/> in which the Fruit is put, and Ground by the ſingle upright Stone moved round by a Horſe, as the Tanners Grind their Bark; in which Mill may be Ground ſometimes three or four Hogſheads a day; and ſome are ſo large, that they Grind half a Hogſhead at a Griſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe Mills are very chargeable to make for any one that hath but an ordinary Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and to carry your Fruit to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Mill, and bring back your <hi>Cider,</hi> &amp;c. is troubleſome, if at any diſtance: And the <hi>Cider</hi> made therein, accuſed of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant taſte, acquired from the Rinds, Stems, and Kernels of the Fruit which in theſe Mills are much bruiſed.</p>
               <p>Some have taken the pains to Grate Apples on a Grater made of perforated <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> ſuch that Houſe-wives uſe to Grate Bread on; Others, to beat them on a Table with Mauls: but theſe ways are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as idle and uſeleſs, where you have any conſiderable plenty of Fruit.</p>
               <p>To remedy the inconveniencies, trouble and expences in thoſe ſeveral ways that have been hitherto uſed, you may erect a Mill, the Ichnography whereof, you have in the following Figure.</p>

                  <p>LEt there be two Planks <hi>a a a a,</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Foot in length or more, and about ſixteen Inches in depth, in caſe your Cylinder or Roll be but one Foot Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, elſe according to the Diameter of your Cylinder, that there be about two Inches above and below the ſame. If your Planks will not bear the breadth deſired, they may be enlarged by addition of a piece of the ſame thickneſs, without any inconvenience. Let the Planks be about two and a half, or three Inches thick, and made to quadrate each to other. Let there be four Mortoiſes in each Plank, as at <hi>b b b b,</hi> for four Tranſomes, to keep the two ſides at an equal diſtance, about half an Inch wider than the length of the Cylinder, that it may have the more liberty to move eaſie without Grating. The four Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes may be pinn'd faſt into that Plank that is next you when you turn, and their Tenons made long at their other ends, that they may be two or three Inches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other Plank, that they may be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101529:57"/> key'd at the farther ſide, the better to take to pieces when occaſion requires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>c</hi> Is the Center of the Cylinder: in each Plank exactly one againſt the other, there muſt be a hole for the Axis to run in, which ought to be ſtrengthned with a ſmall Plate of <hi>Iron</hi> or <hi>Braſs,</hi> to prevent wearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>d d</hi> Shews only the Circumference of the Cylinder, which at <hi>e</hi> appears more plainly, being made of ſolid <hi>Oak,</hi> or <hi>Beech,</hi> the dryer the better, and freer from ſhrinking, of about a Foot or eighteen Inches in length; and if a Foot in length, then eighteen Inches in Diameter; if eighteen Inches in lenth, then a Foot in Diameter; after which rate you may vary as you pleaſe. This Roll or Cylinder muſt be turned ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly on its Axis, which muſt be made of Iron of about an Inch ſquare, and fixed through the Center of the Cylinder: then turning it on that Axis, with a turning Goudge and Chiſel, will cauſe it to run true; which is principally to be obſerved. The Axis muſt extend beyond the Cylinder ſix or ſeven Inches at the one end, where it muſt be flatned an Inch or two, with an Eye, that the Hand-wheel may be key'd on there, as at <hi>f.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Cylinder after it is placed between
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101529:58"/> the two Planks in its Frame, muſt be knock'd full of ſmall Peggs of Iron, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three quarters of an Inch in length, made flat, and tapering like a Wedge, as at <hi>g.</hi> They muſt not ſtand or appear a full quarter of an Inch above the ſuperficies of the Cylinder: for the ſhorter they are, the finer will your pulp or Murc be; and the higher, the courſer: you may place them in ſuch order, that the one may ſtand againſt the ſpace laſt preceding, in a Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunxial Order; about four or five hundred of them will ſerve for a Cylinder of a Foot in length, and of the like Diameter, and ſo after that rate for a greater or leſſer. Thus will this Cylinder be made rough to Grind your Apples as fine as you pleaſe. Then cut a piece of Wood of the length of the Cylinder, and about a fourth part of its Circumference, hollow almoſt to the Circumferential line of the Cylinder, as at <hi>h:</hi> this piece muſt have a Pin at each ſide neer the upper part of it, as at <hi>i i,</hi> which muſt have holes in the two Planks for them to move eaſie in, as at <hi>k.</hi> The uſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to keep the Apples cloſe to the rough Cylinder, that they may be throughly Ground; this is alſo govern'd by a move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Tranſome that extends from the one
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:101529:58"/> Plank to the other, through the Mortoiſes at <hi>l,</hi> which Mortoiſes are made broad, to admit of Key's to force the Regulator or piece of Wood neerer or farther as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>There muſt alſo be another piece of Wood cut hollow, made to move neerer or farther, as occaſion requires, as <hi>m,</hi> which ſerves as a <hi>Regulator</hi> to keep the Apples from feeding too faſt. This alſo may have ſome Iron Pegs on the under-ſide of it, the better to preſerve the Apples ſteady to their work. Which <hi>Regulator</hi> may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced neerer or farther by Wedges as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>The prickt lines ſhew the Boards that deſcend from the Hopper or Bin, to direct the Apples to their work.</p>
                  <p>Note, that the greateſt inconveniency that ever hapned in ſeveral years experience of this <hi>Ingenio,</hi> was, that mellow Apples being Pulpy and light, would ſtick to the Cylinder, that it would much impede the Operation; which is eaſily prevented by making the Cylinder ſmooth, and placing the Pegs of Iron not too neer, but leaving ſufficient ſpaces; that when the Cylinder is wet with the Juice of the Apples, the Pulp may fall from it in its motion; which it will
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:101529:59"/> eaſily do, and the better, if the Pegs be not flat headed: always obſerving, that the diſtances or ſpaces of one Row, may be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or ſupplied in the next two or three Rows, that the Apple may not wear in Ridges.</p>
                  <p>By this <hi>Ingenio,</hi> have been Ground ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine, ſometimes four, and ſometimes five Buſhels of Apples in an hour, and with no harder labour, then that two ordinary Labourers may, the one feeding, and the other grinding, hold it, by interchanging, all the day.</p>
                  <p>But if your Stock be ſo great, that this ſmall and eaſie <hi>Ingenio</hi> will not diſpatch them faſt enough, or that you intend it for a general uſe; Then may you make your Planks the longer, and place two Rolls or Cylinders, each with a handle as the former, the one handle on the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide; which Rolls may be cut in Groves like the Teeth of a Wheel, and made to fall the one Tooth in the other ſpace, according to <hi>a</hi> in the ſecond Figure.</p>
                  <p>In this form the Center or Axis of the one Cylinder muſt be moveable, by means of pieces in the inſide of the Planks, made to be wedged neerer or farther as occaſion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101529:59"/> requires, as <hi>b b</hi> in Figure the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Teeth on the Cylinders when they are moved the one againſt the other, forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attract the Apples which are emitted under, throughly bruiſed.</p>
                  <p>Alſo you may turn thoſe Teeth with a Gouge and Chiſel the other way, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears at <hi>c,</hi> in Figure the ſecond, and make rough either by notching or pegging the outward edges of both Rolls, by which means the Apples will be attracted and throughly Ground.</p>
                  <p>By this <hi>Ingenio</hi> may two Workmen and one Feeder Grind twenty Buſhels of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in an hour; always obſerving, that you feed it no faſter than it can well diſpatch them, becauſe it is apt to choak. Many profitable additions may be added to either of theſe ways by the ingenious, but the ignorant contemns any thing that is novel, though nere ſo excellent.</p>
                  <p>When you bring your Apples to the Mill, <note place="margin">Picking of Fruit.</note> as you fill them up, caſt by all ſuch that are green and unripe, rotten, or otherwiſe naught, and all Stalks, Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that may injure yoor <hi>Cider:</hi> for it is better to want a ſmall quantity of your liquor, than to ſpoil the whole.</p>
                  <p>Some are of opinion, that Rottenneſs in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101529:60"/> the Apple injureth not the <hi>Cider,</hi> but that a convenient quantity of rotten Apples mixt with the ſound, is a great help to the fermentation and clarification of the <hi>Cider.</hi> But I preſume, they mean ſuch Apples one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that have been bruiſed in gathering, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king down, or carrying, which will by lying become rotten, and (the ſkin being whole) be not much the worſe, onely the <hi>Cider</hi> will retain a ſmack of them: yet let me adviſe, that you admit not them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt your <hi>Cider</hi> that you intend for keeping, but rather make <hi>Cider</hi> of them for a more early ſpending: for others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that one rotten Apple corrupts a whole Veſſel; which I ſuppoſe is intended onely of the putrid Rottenneſs.</p>
                  <p>When your Apples are grinding, it is not good to grind them too ſmall, for then too much of the Pulp paſſes with the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; but if they are not too ſmall ground, you will have but little the leſs of <hi>Cider,</hi> (although the contrary be commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) becauſe in the more vulgar way of grinding or beating, much of the Apple eſcapes unbruiſed, unleſs the whole be very much bruiſed.</p>
                  <p>After your Fruit is ground, 'tis good to let it ſtand 24 or 48 hours, according as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101529:60"/> your time or conveniencie will admit, ſo that it be all together, or in good quantities in large Veſſels; for ſtanding thus, it not onely undergoes one degree of fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or maturation, but acquires colour, much commended in <hi>Cider,</hi> and alſo cauſes the leſſer parts of the Apple unbruiſed, eaſily to part with its Juice in the Preſs: although the general advice be, to preſs it immediately from the Mill.</p>
                  <p>You may leave a paſſage open in the bottom of your Vat, wherein you keep your bruiſed Apples, during the time of its being therein. Some of the <hi>Cider</hi> may ſpontaneouſly diſtill into a Receiver placed under it; or you may have a falſe bottom in the inſide full of holes, that the greater quantity may be had, which may run through ſome Tap or other paſſage into your Receiver.</p>
                  <p>Which <hi>Cider</hi> ſo obtained, far exceeds that which is forc'd out; as the Wines of <hi>France</hi> that are unpreſs'd, are by much preferr'd to thoſe that are preſs'd; and live Honey that diſtills of it ſelf from the Combs, is much better than that which remains.</p>
                  <p>As for your Preſs, there is no form yet <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Cider<hi>-Preſs.</hi>
                     </note> diſcovered that exceeds the Skrew-preſs, of which ſort there are very large, that a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101529:61"/> Hogſhead may be preſſed at once; and as ſome report, that a Hogſhead or two runs out commonly before the Apples ſuffer any conſiderable preſſure.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe large Preſſes, the uſual way is to preſs it in Straw, by laying clean Wheat-ſtraw in the bottom of the Preſs, and a heap of bruiſed Apples upon it; and ſo with wiſps of Straw, by twiſting of it, and taking the ends of the Bed of Straw, with it you go round your heap of Apples, which are to be encreaſed, until by wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round the Straw, and addition of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, you have raiſed it two foot or more, as your Preſs will give leave: then apply your Board and Skrew over it, and you may preſs it dry in form of a Cheeſe, which is the moſt expeditious way, and moſt for advantage, of any way yet known; for a ſmall ſingle Mill, after the form before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, will grinde in one day, as much as a man can well preſs in a good Skrew-preſs in another. Some of theſe large Skrew-preſſes are made of two Skrews, and ſome but of one: but in caſe your ſtock be but ſmall, a leſs Skrew, and of much leſs price may ſerve, made after the form of that in the Frontiſpiece; and in ſtead of Straw, you may have a Baſket or Crib well made,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101529:61"/> and put Straw round it in the inſide, to preſerve the Pulp, which would otherwiſe either run through, in caſe the paſſage be wide, or choak them, in caſe they be nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; or a Hair-bag placed in a Crib or Frame made under the Skrew, to preſerve the Bag from tearing.</p>
                  <p>In your preſſing, in caſe you intend not to uſe your Pulp afterwards for the making of <hi>Water-cider,</hi> uſually called <hi>Purre,</hi> then is it beſt to preſs it as dry as you can; but in caſe you reſolve to adde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to your Murc, and to preſs it again, then you need not preſs it too hard; for your <hi>Cider</hi> will then be the worſe, and ſo will your <hi>Purre:</hi> For the laſt ſqueezing is the weakeſt, and makes your <hi>Cider</hi> the rougher; and if any thing will, that gives it a woody taſte, unleſs it be prevented in the eaſie grinding.</p>

               <p>As your Veſſel fills under your Preſs, pour it through ſome Streyner into a large Vat, onely to detain groſs pieces of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from intermixing in the Vat; from whence moſt preſcribe to tun it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

               </p>
               <p>Now when it is in your Tun or Vat, it ought to be there fermented, and in ſome degree purified, and from thence the pure ſeparated from the impure, and ſo Tun'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Veſſels wherein it is to be preſerved, that the Dregs may not paſs with it, which will very much incommode your <hi>Cider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order to which, it is to be underſtood, that the juice of ripe Pulpy Apples, as <hi>Pip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pins, Renetings,</hi> &amp;c. is of a ſyrrupy and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious nature, that whilſt it is cold, doth deteyn in it diſperſed thoſe particles of the Fruit, that by the preſſure comes with the Liquor, and is not by ſtanding or frequent percolations ſeparable from it; which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, or flying Lee, being part of the fleſh or body of the Apple, is (equally with the Apple it ſelf, when bruiſed) ſubject to putrifaction: by which means, by degrees, the <hi>Cider</hi> becomes hard or acid; but if it be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101529:62"/> preſſed from other Apples, as <hi>Readſtreak, Gennet-moyle,</hi> &amp;c. that more eaſily part with their Liquor, without the adheſion of ſo much of the Pulp, &amp; which is of a more thin body; This Liquor ſhall not be ſo ſubject to reiterated fermentation, nor ſo ſoon to aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, becauſe it wants that more corrupt part that in the other comes with it.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Wine, Ale, Beer,</hi> and other Liquors, in every degree that they tend to acidity, they become more cleer, by the precipitation, of the more groſs parts that are firſt ſubject to putrefaction by the vertue &amp; heat whereof, the Spirits are chaſed away; &amp; ſo in time, as thoſe corrupt particles were more or leſs in it, is the Liquor ſooner or later become Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Beer,</hi> whereof <hi>Vinegar</hi> is intended to be made, is never fermented, nor the feces pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated at the firſt, as it is when it is to be preſerved for drinking. And <hi>Claret-wine</hi> percolated through <hi>Rape,</hi> or the acid <hi>Murc</hi> of <hi>Grapes,</hi> becomes a <hi>White Vinegar;</hi> ſo that the precipitation that is in both thoſe Liquors, happens by reaſon of their becoming acid.</p>
               <p>If therefore you intend your <hi>Cider</hi> ſhall retain its full ſtrength and body, and to preſerve it ſo for any conſiderable time, endeavour to abſtract from it that flying
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101529:63"/> Lee, or <hi>Materia Terreſtris,</hi> that floats in it (as ſometimes it does in Muſt preſſed from <hi>Grapes,</hi> that hath in it more of an active principle than that from <hi>Apples)</hi> leſt your <hi>Cider</hi> be thereby impaired.</p>
               <p>Neither is it to be imagined, that that ſort of <hi>Cider</hi> that is of that tenacious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as to keep up its Lee, is therefore ſtronger than that which more eaſily lets it ſubſide; any more than that thick ſmall unfermented <hi>Ale,</hi> ſhould be ſtronger than that which hath more of the Spirit or Tincture of the Mault, and well defecated; or that <hi>Wine</hi> ſhould be ſmaller than <hi>Cider</hi> for the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now rightly to underſtand the cauſe of this detention of Lee in the body of the Liquor, you are to conſider, that there are ſeveral ſorts of Fruits that yield a cleer and limpid Juice, as a <hi>Grape,</hi> and a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Flanders Cherry,</hi> and ſome others; and other ſorts of Fruit that yield a more groſs Juice, as a <hi>Rasberry, Black-Cherries, Plums,</hi> and ſome others: and that there are ſome Fruits that yield a very thin and clear Juice at a certain degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity; which a little after, when more ripe, it becomes more thick and groſs; as a <hi>Gooſeberry, Currant,</hi> and ſome ſpecies of <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:101529:63"/>
               <p> In the <hi>Grape,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Flanders Cherry,</hi> the cauſe that the Liquid part ſo eaſily parts from the more ſolid, may be from the great inequality in the proportion of the parts, the liquid being the more, and overcoming the leſſer: which in the other, <hi>Cherries, Rasberries,</hi> and <hi>Plums,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary happens, that much of the Pulp ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to the Liquor.</p>
               <p>Alſo in the other Fruits, as <hi>Gooſeberries, Currants,</hi> and ſome <hi>Apples</hi> and <hi>Pears,</hi> by the length of time, a thorow maturation cauſes a ſolution of the more groſs parts, being of themſelves tender, which makes them ſo acceptable to the <hi>Palate;</hi> which in Fruit more inſoluble doth not ſo happen; yet may the Juice of thoſe Fruits that thus may be extracted more pure and limpid, be more excellent, and be preferr'd to thoſe more groſs, as it uſually happens, becauſe of the difficulty of defecation.</p>
               <p>One principal help to purify any Liquor, or to provoke fermentation, is warmth, as is vulgarly practiſed amongſt Houſewives, who in fermenting both Bread and Beer, preſerve it warm during that operation. For any liquid Body, wherein fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is required, by warmth becomes more thin, that it eaſily admits of a ſeparation
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101529:64"/> of the feculent parts; and like unto a glutinous Body, the colder it is, the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it is, and doth not ſo eaſily part with its Feces.</p>
               <p>As hath been ſometime experienced in <hi>Cider,</hi> by heating a ſmall portion of it <note place="margin">By warmth only.</note> ſcalding hot, and caſting it into the Tun on the new Muſt, ſtirring it together, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over, hath cauſed a good fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſeparation of its Lee, making it much more fit for preſervation, than if it had been Barrel'd without any fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all. It hath been alſo obſerv'd, that cool Cellars do protract the fining of <hi>Cider:</hi> And that <hi>Cider</hi> expoſed to the Sun, or other warmth, hath more eaſily fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and become fine, for the reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>But to ferment and purify this <hi>Britiſh-Wine,</hi> or any other <hi>Vinous Liquor</hi> effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">By Iſinglaſs.</note> you may take of <hi>Gluten piſcis, Water-Glew,</hi> or <hi>Iſinglaſs,</hi> as it is uſually termed, about the proportion of three or four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to a Hoſhead, rather more than leſs; beat it thin on ſome Anvil, or Iron-wedg; cut it in ſmall pieces, and lay it in ſteep in <hi>White-Wine</hi> (which will more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it than any other Liquor, except <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar,</hi> Spirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are not fit to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101529:64"/> uſed in this Work) let it lie therein all night; the next day keep it ſome time o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a gentle Fire, till you find it well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved; then take a part of your <hi>Cider,</hi> or ſuch liquor you intend to purify, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion about a Gallon to twenty Gallons; in which boyl your diſſolved Water-glew, and caſt it into the whole maſs of Liquor, ſtirring it well about, and covering it cloſe. So let it ſtand to ferment, for eight, ten, or twelve hours, as you pleaſe; during which time, the <hi>Water-glew</hi> being thinly and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſperſed through the whole Maſs of Liquor, and aſſiſted by the warmth and pretenuity of it, precipitates a part of that groſs Lee, that otherwiſe would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed it, and raiſeth another more light part of it, as a Net carrieth before it Leaves or any other groſs matter in the Water through which it is drawn, and leaveth not any part of its own Body in the purified Liquor, to alter or injure the Subſtance or Taſte of it. Which, when you obſerve that it hath done working, you may draw out at a Tap below from the Scum, or may firſt gently take off the Scum as you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>This Liquor thus gently purified, may you in a full Veſſel well cloſed, preſerve a long time, if you pleaſe, or draw it and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101529:65"/> bottle it in a few days, there being no more <hi>Lee</hi> in it than is neceſſary for its preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>But if you will have it yet clearer and finer, you may encreaſe your proportion of <hi>Water-glew</hi> to double that proportion before mentioned, and make it thereby perfectly <hi>limpid;</hi> which is but an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racking of it, and makes it too lean and thin of ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>This very way or Method of purification will ſerve in all ſorts of Liquors, and is much to be preferred in the Juices of Fruits, to that vulgar way of making them ferment by the addition of Yeaſt or Toſts therein dipp'd, as is uſually preſcribed; that being but an acid Excitation to Fermentation, all things tending to Acidity being (as much as may be) to be avoided in our operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>This way alſo is better than the tedious ways of percolation, and racking from Veſſel to Veſſel; which waſts not only the Spirits, but ſubſtance of the Liquor it ſelf, and leaves you but a thin and flat Drink, hardly ballancing your trouble.</p>
               <p>After you have thus purified your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Drawing it o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101529:65"/> Tap near the bottom, as is uſual, You may draw it from the feces over the brim of the Veſſel, by a <hi>Siphon</hi> made of <hi>Latten,</hi> or of <hi>Glaſs,</hi> which is the beſt, becauſe you may obſerve by your Eye, what impurities aſcend, and avoid them by raiſing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing your Inſtrument at your diſcretion. The <hi>Siphon</hi> is after this form, the one end three or four Inches longer than the other, and the hollowneſs of the Pipe according to the uſe you intend to put it into, whether out of a great or ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
               <p>Liquors thus purified, leave behind them on their ſuperficies, and at bottom, a great quantity of groſs and impure feces; which if from <hi>Cider,</hi> you may caſt on the preſs'd <hi>Murc,</hi> to meliorate your <hi>Ciderkin,</hi> or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<hi>-Cider,</hi> if you intend to make any.</p>
               <p>Theſe impurities, which are in great plenty in pulpy Fruit, and alſo in <hi>Rasberies, Currants,</hi> &amp;c. are the principal cauſe of the decaying of thoſe Liquors by their corrupt and acid nature, exciting the more vivous parts to a continual fermentation, as is evident from the effect, and from the breaking of Bottles (wherein this <hi>Lee</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains) on the motion of a Southerly Air.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:101529:66"/>
               <p> After your Liquors are thus purified and drawn off, they are to be encloſed in ſome Veſſel for ſome Weeks or Months, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the nature of the Liquor or your occaſions will permit or require.

               <p>It hath been no ſmall occaſion of the <note place="margin">Of Barrels.</note> badneſs of this Liquor, and thereby gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it an ill name, that it hath been uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ill treated, and entertained (after it hath been indifferently well made) in ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaped, corrupt, faulty and unſound Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; Vinous Liquors being full of Wild Spirits that eaſily find Vents, through which the Air corrupts the whole remaining Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and alſo more eaſily, eſpecially the <hi>Cider,</hi> like the Apple, attracting any ill ſavor from the Veſſel. Therefore care is to be taken about the choiſe of them.</p>
               <p>It hath been obſerved, that the larger any Veſſels is, the better Liquors are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in them. In ſome forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Veſſels being made, that one of them
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101529:66"/> will contain many Hogſheads of Wine; which being therein in ſo great a quantity, is preſerved much better than if divided into leſſer Veſſels.</p>
               <p>Alſo the form of a Barrel hath been found to be very material: although the vulgar round Barrel be moſt uſeful and neceſſary for Tranſportation from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet is the upright Veſſel, whoſe Ribs are ſtreight, and the head about a fourth or fifth part broader than the bottom, and the height equal to the Diameter of the upper part, the beſt form to ſtand in a Cellar. The bung-hole of about two Inches Diameter, is to be on the top, with a Plug of Wood turn'd round exactly to fit into it, near unto which muſt be a ſmall Vent-hole, that after the <hi>Cider</hi> is tunn'd up, and ſtopt at the Bung, you may give it Vent at pleaſure; and that when you draw it forth, you may thereby admit Air into the Veſſel. This form is preferr'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that moſt Liquors contract a Skin or Cream on the top, which helps much to their preſervation, and is in other forms broken by the ſinking of the Liquor, but in this is kept whole; which occaſions the freſhneſs of the Drink to the laſt.</p>
               <p>It is alſo obſerved, that a new Veſſel
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101529:67"/> made of Oak, tinges any Liquor at the firſt with a brown Colour; wherefore it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient thorowly to ſeaſon your new Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with ſcalding water, wherein you may boyl Apple-pumis if you pleaſe, before you put your <hi>Cider</hi> in them; which when ſo ſeaſon'd, are to be preferr'd to any that have been uſed, unleſs after <hi>Canary, Malaga,</hi> or <hi>Sherry</hi> Wines, or after <hi>Metheglin;</hi> which will much advance the colour and ſavour of your <hi>Cider:</hi> but Veſſels out of which Strong-Beer or <hi>Ale</hi> have been lately drawn, are to be rejected, unleſs thorowly ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſeaſon'd as before, which then will ſerve indifferently well, nothing agreeing worſe with <hi>Cider</hi> than <hi>Malt;</hi> for of <hi>Cider</hi> or Water<hi>-Cider,</hi> boyl'd and added to <hi>Malt,</hi> hath been made a Liquor not at all grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Small-Beer-Veſſels well ſcalded, are not amiſs: <hi>White</hi> or Rheniſh-Wine-Veſſels may do well for preſent drinking, or for a Luſcious <hi>Cider,</hi> elſe they are apt to cauſe too great a fermentation.</p>
               <p>If your Veſſel be muſty, Boyl Pepper in <note place="margin">Curing muſty Cask.</note> Water after the Proportion of an Ounce to a Hogſhead; fill your Veſſel therewith ſcalding hot, and ſo let it ſtand two or three days; or elſe</p>
               <p>Take two or three Stones or more of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:101529:67"/> Quick-lime to ſix or ſeven gallons of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which put into a Hogſhead, and ſtop it cloſe, and tumble it up and down till the Lime be throughly ſlak'd.</p>
               <p>Glaſs-bottles are preferr'd to Stone-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, <note place="margin">Bottles.</note> becauſe that Stone-bottles are apt to leak, and are rough in the mouth, that they are not eaſily uncork'd; alſo they are more apt to taint than the other; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they tranſparent, that you may diſcern when they are foul or clean: it being otherwiſe with the Glaſs-bottles, whoſe defects are eaſily diſcern'd, and are of a more compact metal or ſubſtance, not waſting ſo many Corks.</p>
               <p>To prevent the charge of which, you <note place="margin">Grinding Glaſs Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> may, with a Turn made for that purpoſe, grinde or fit Glaſs-ſtopples to each Bottle, ſo apt, that no Liquor or Spirit ſhall pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate its cloſures; always obſerving to keep each Stopple to its Bottle: which is eaſily done, by ſecuring it with a piece of Packthread, each Stopple having a Button on the top of it for that end. Theſe Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are ground with the Powder of the Stone <hi>Smyris,</hi> ſold at the Shops by the vulgar name of <hi>Emery,</hi> which with Oyl will exquiſitely work the Glaſs to your pleaſure.</p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:101529:68"/>
               <p> The onely Objection againſt this way of Cloſure, is, That not giving paſſage for any Spirits, the Liquors are apt to force the Bottles; which in Bottles ſtopt with Cork rarely happens, the Cork being ſomewhat porous, part of the Spirits, though with difficulty, perſpire.</p>
               <p>If Glaſs-bottles happen to be muſty, they are eaſily cured by boyling them in a Veſſel of water, putting them in whilſt the water is cold, which prevents the danger of breaking; being alſo cautious that you ſet them not down ſuddenly on a cold Floor, but on Straw, Board, or ſuch-like.</p>

Be ſure to leave the Bung open, or onely cover'd two or three days, that the <hi>Cider</hi> may have liberty to finiſh its ſermentation; but if it be ſo
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101529:68"/> cleer that it will not again ferment, and that you are willing or intend to keep it long, put in unground Wheat after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a Quart to a Hogſhead, which will give it a head ſufficient to preſerve it. This artificial head is onely where an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Air may probably be into the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>After you have thus cloſed up your Bung, you ought yet to leave open the ſmall Vent-hole onely looſely, putting in the Peg, leſt otherwiſe the wilde Spirit of the <hi>Cider</hi> force a paſſage, as I have known it a week after its tunning to have heav'd up the head of the Barrel almoſt to a Rupture; which by the eaſie ſtopping this Vent, and ſometimes opening it, may be prevented until you finde it hath waſted that wilde Spirit. For the Vulgar advice of barrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up <hi>Cider</hi> from the Preſs, and then ſtopping it cloſe, is pernicious to this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, many having ſpoil'd it by this means: the Spirits ſeeking for a vent will finde it, and the more they are pent, the longer will they be before they are expended; which vent being neglected by the Cideriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a paſſage for the beſt Spirits of the <hi>Cider</hi> many times, to its abſolute ſpoiling.</p>
               <p>The vulgar opinion of the ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101529:69"/> or flatning of <hi>Cider,</hi> is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, ſcarce any Drink being more eaſily preſerv'd than this; and though much of its Spirits be loſt, yet out of its own body, whilſt new, may they be again reviv'd, it ſuffering much more by too ſoon detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Spirits, than by too lax a cloſure.</p>
               <p>Stopping of <hi>Cider</hi> with Clay, if you deſigne to keep it long, cannot be good, it having ſo ſtrong a Spirit that it will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily raiſe it on every <hi>Southerly</hi> Air; nothing being better than a wooden Plug turn'd fit to the Bung-hole, and covered about with a ſingle Brown-paper wet, before you wring it into its place.</p>
               <p>Drawing of <hi>Cider</hi> into Bottles, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bottling of</hi> Cider.</note> keeping it in them well ſtopt for ſome time, is a great improver of <hi>Cider.</hi> This is done after it is throughly purified, and at any time of the year: if it be bottled early, there needs no addition, it having Body and Spirit enough to retrive in the Bottle what it loſt in the Barrel; but if it hath been over-fermented, and thereby become poor, flat, and eager, then in the bottling if you adde a ſmall quantity of Loaf-ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, more or leſs according as it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, it will give a new life to the <hi>Cider,</hi> and probably make it better than ever it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101529:69"/> was before, eſpecially if it were but a little acid, and not eager.</p>
               <p>When your <hi>Cider</hi> is thus bottled, if it were new at the bottling, and not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure, it is good to let the Bottles ſtand a while before you ſtop them cloſe, or elſe open the Corks two or three days after to give the <hi>Cider</hi> air, which will prevent the breaking the Bottles againſt the next change of the wind into the <hi>South.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great care is to be had in chooſing good Corks, much good Liquor being abſolutely ſpoiled through the onely defect of the Cork; therefore are Glaſs Stopples to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, in caſe the accident of breaking the Bottles can be prevented.</p>
               <p>If the Corks are ſteep'd in ſcalding wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while before you uſe them, they will comply better with the mouth of the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, than if forc'd in dry: alſo the moiſture of the Cork doth advantage it in detaining the Spirits.</p>
               <p>Therefore is laying the Bottles ſideways to be commended, not onely for preſerving the Corks moiſt, but for that the Air that remains in the Bottle is on the ſide of the Bottle where it can neither expire, nor can new be admitted, the Liquor being againſt the Cork, which not ſo eaſily paſſeth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101529:70"/> through the Cork as the Air. Some place their Bottles on a Frame with their noſes downwards for that end; which is not to be ſo well approved of, by reaſon that if there be any the leaſt ſettling in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, you are ſure to have it in the firſt Glaſs.</p>
               <p>Placing the Bottles on a Frame, as is uſual, or on Shelves, is not ſo good as on the ground, by reaſon that the farther from the earth they ſtand, the more ſubject they are to the variation of the Air, which is more rare in the upper part of a Cellar or other Room, than in the lower; and a few inches will occaſion a great change, unleſs in a Room arched or vaulted with Stone: but where Room is wanting, this inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience may be eaſily born withal.</p>
               <p>Setting Bottles in Sand is by many not onely made uſe of, but commended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without cauſe, it not adding that coldneſs to the Bottles as is generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, being rather of a dry and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quality than cold; if there be any convenience in it, it is becauſe it defends them from the too ſudden changes of Air into heat or cold, which in open and not deep Rooms it is often ſubject unto.</p>
               <p>The placing of Bottles in Ciſterns of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101529:70"/> Spring-water, either running or often changed, is without all Peradventure the beſt way to preſerve <hi>Cider</hi> or any other Vinous Liquors. A Conſervatory made where a recruit of a cool refrigerating Spring-water may conveniently be had, will ſo long preſerve <hi>Cider</hi> until it be come to the ſtrength even of <hi>Canary</hi> it ſelf. Bottles let down into Wells of water where Pumps are, that the frequent uſe of Buckets may not injure them; or little Vaults made in the ſides of Wells neer the bottom, may ſupply the defect of Spring-water in your Cellar. The reaſon why Water is to be preferr'd for ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatory, is, becauſe the cloſeneſs of its body admits not of a ſudden rarefaction of Air, as other Materials do, but is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of an equal degree of coldneſs, and that colder than commonly the Liquor is that is preſerv'd; which ſo condenſeth its Spirits, that they ſeek not any exition or expanſion, but acquieſce in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per body, where they multiply and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more and more mature, by vertue of that innate heat the Liquor received whilſt in its Fruit. <hi>Quaere</hi> whether the warmth that is in Wells or deep Springs, in froſty weather, incommode not theſe Liquors?
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101529:71"/> Alſo <hi>Quaere</hi> whether theſe cool Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories prevent not the breaking of Bottles ſtopt with Glaſs Stopples, by the conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power of the water.

               <p>Where you have not the conveniency of Water, or are unwilling to be at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as in ſome places it may require, of making ſuch Conſervatories; there the beſt way is to dig Vaults in your Cellars, under the Level of the bottome, or to make Niches in the Walls near the Ground, and in them place your Bottles leaning: for the more they are remote from the Air, and the more encompaſſed with Stone or Earth, the cooler they will continue, and the leſs ſubject to the inconveniencies that happen from the mutability of the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Air.</p>
               <p>To accelerate maturity in your Bottle-drink, you may place them above Stairs
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:101529:73"/> in ſome Room warm'd by the Beams of the Sun; which will much haſten its maturity, and is eaſier performed than any Agitation can be: but thus it will not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and caution muſt be had to your Bottles.</p>
               <p>Binding down the Corks of your Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles in caſe of danger, is not ſo much to be commended, as well fitting them in by full Corks; becauſe the Liquor were better fly the Cork than break the Bottle, which muſt be, in caſe the Cork be tyed down, and the Liquor not well qualified.</p>

This way is not to be commended, becauſe the Juice of the Apple is either apt to extract ſome ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from the Braſs or Copper, we being not acquainted with any other Veſſels to boyl it in, or the feces or ſediment of it apt to burn by its adhering to the ſides of the Veſſel, it being boyl'd in a naked Fire.</p>
               <p>But if you are willing to boyl your <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> your Veſſel ought to be of <hi>Latten,</hi> which may be made large enough to boyl
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:101529:73"/> a good quantity, the <hi>Tin</hi> yielding no bad Tincture to the Liquor. The Veſſel alſo ought to be broad and open, for the more expeditious waſting of the aqueous and Phlegmatick part of the Liquor, which firſt flies, in caſe the Muſt be newly taken from the Preſs, and the Apples ripened on the Tree, ground as ſoon as gathered, and preſſed as ſoon as ground: For it is not the boyling only, but the ſudden waſting of the Phlegmatick part, that meliorates the remainder; the Spirits in all Liquors reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and contracting themſelves before Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, as in all Muſts, and after putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as in <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and all acid eager Liquors. For obſerve, how much ſoever you waſt in this evaporation of any ſort of Muſt, or new Wurt, by ſo much is that which remains the ſtronger; ſo that you need not be ſo intent to procure Ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as expence of the meaner part of your Liquor. Alſo you may place this <hi>Latten</hi> Veſſel in another Veſſel of Water, or in a thin Bed of Aſhes, to prevent the too fierce heat of the naked Fire; alſo you may keep it ſtirring, which will expedite the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:101529:74"/> ſtopping it again. <hi>Cider</hi> that is dead or flat will oftentimes revive again of it ſelf, if cloſe ſtopt, upon the revolution of the year and approaching Summer.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Cider</hi> be acid, as ſometimes it happens by reaſon of the immaturity of the Fruit, too nimble an Operation, too great a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in the Veſſel, or too warm a Scituation of your Veſſels wherein it is kept; this ſometimes becomes pleaſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in caſe its Lee be yet in the Veſſel, as is ſuppoſed by a ſecond operation on it, but in caſe it doth not, if you add about a Gallon of unground-Wheat to a Hogſhead of it, it will very much ſweeten it, and make it pleaſant.

               <p>But the better way for this operation is, by making a little Earthen pot wherein to burn your Brimſtone, the cover of it to extend in a Pipe about two Foot for your Mouth, and another Pipe to go out of the ſide of the Pot into the Bung-hole of the Veſſel, in which the <hi>Cider</hi> is put to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: about half way deep into the Liquor, put your Rags dipp'd in Brimſtone, into the pot, add Fire to it, cover your pot, blow at your Pipe, which will encreaſe the Fire, and drive the Fume into the middle of the Liquor in the Barrel, and alſo fill the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies of the Veſſel; Then ſtop it cloſe, by which means the <hi>Cider</hi> is impregnated with the Spirit of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which will give it no alteration, ſave only for its ſalubrity and duration.</p>

               <p>It is obſerv'd that many ſorts of Apples thorowly mature, will endure ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Water, without any prejudice to the Drink, eſpecially in the Iſland of <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> where they frequently give it a daſh.

               <p>To ſome ſorts of Fruit that are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acid, crude, or of a thin Juice, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is very improper; but if the Water be boyl'd, and let ſtand till it be cold, it will be the better; that abating much of its crudity.</p>
               <p>Water mixt with the Fruit in the Grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, incorporateth better with the <hi>Cider,</hi> than if added in the Veſſel; and if mixt in the Veſſel, better than if added in the Glaſs.

This being the moſt part Water, will clarify of it ſelf, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the place of Small-Beer in a Family, and to many much more acceptable.</p>
               <p>You may amend it by the addition of the Setling or Lee of your <hi>Cider</hi> that you laſt purifyed, by putting it up on the Pulp before preſſure, or by adding ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of <hi>Cider,</hi> that your other Veſſels will not hold, or by Grinding ſome falling or refuſe Apples that were not fit to be added to your <hi>Cider,</hi> and preſſing it with this.</p>

This <hi>Wine</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in your Refrigeratoty, will continue good for ſeveral years; its Spirits thereby multiplying and heightning, that makes it equal to thoſe <hi>Wines</hi> that received a far greater degree of maturation in their Fruit more expoſed to the perpendicular Beams of the Sun.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any Fruit more eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated <note place="margin">Cherry-wine.</note> than the <hi>Cherry,</hi> nor any Fruit that bears more conſtantly and plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that is a tall and Orchard-Tree, the Fruit whereof yields a fine acid pleaſant Juice, and mix'd with the more fat and luſcious Wines of <hi>Spain,</hi> make a very good Wine, by the addition of Sugar whereby to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>Or the Juice it ſelf, gently preſſed from the Fruit, may, by a convenient addition of Sugar, make a very pleaſant Wine, and durable, if boyled together; but in the boyling caution muſt be had, leſt it attract ſome ill ſavour from the Veſſel.</p>
               <p>This Fruit is alſo eaſie of Propagation, <note place="margin">Plum-wine.</note> and no doubt but ſome of the more juicie ſort of them, eſpecially the <hi>Damſin,</hi> would yield an excellent Liquor, but ſcarcely durable unleſs boyl'd with Sugar, and well
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:101529:81"/> purifi'd, or elſe the Sugar boyl'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in water, and then added: the Juice of the <hi>Plum</hi> being of a thick ſubſtance, will eaſily bear dilution. This is eaſily experimented where <hi>Plums</hi> are in great plenty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Red Dutch-Currant,</hi> or <hi>Corinth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Currant-wine.</note> yields a very rich and well-coloured Juice, which if ſuffered to hang on the Trees ſix or ſeven weeks after they are red, will yield a Vinous Liquor, which is to be dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an equal quantity of water boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with refined Sugar, about the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one pound to a gallon of your Wine (when mixt with the water) and after the Water and Sugar ſo boyled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is cold, then mix it with the Juice of the <hi>Currants,</hi> and purifie it with <hi>Iſinglaſs</hi> diſſolv'd in part of the ſame Liquor, or in <hi>Whitewine,</hi> as is before directed for the purifying of <hi>Cider,</hi> after the rate of an ounce to eight or ten Gallons; but boyl it not in a Braſs Veſſel, for the reaſons before-mentioned. This will raiſe a Scum on it of a great thickneſs, and leave your Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different clear, which you may draw out either at a Tap, or by your <hi>Siphon,</hi> into a Barrel, where it will finiſh its Fermentation, and in three weeks or a Month become ſo
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101529:82"/> pure and limpid, that you may Bottle it with a piece of Loaf-Sugar in each Bottle, in bigneſs according to your diſcretion; which will not only abate its quick acidity that it may as yet retain, but make it briſk and lively.</p>
               <p>At the time you Bottle it, and for ſome time after, it will taſte a little ſweet-ſowre, from the Sugar, and from the <hi>Currant;</hi> but after it hath ſtood in the Bottles ſix or eight weeks, it will be ſo well united, that it will be a delicate, Palatable, rich Wine, tranſparent as the Ruby, of a full Body, and in a <hi>Refrigeratory</hi> very durable; and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you keep it, the more <hi>Vinous</hi> will your Liquor be.</p>
               <p>By the letting your <hi>Currants</hi> hang on the Trees until they are through ripe, which is long after they are become red, digeſts and matures their Juice, that it needs not that large addition of Sugar, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would do, in caſe the Fruit had been gathered when they firſt ſeem'd to be ripe, as is vulgarly uſed, and the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts direct. Alſo it makes the Liquor more ſpirituous and Vinous, and more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of duration, than otherwiſe it would be, if the Fruit had not received ſo great a ſhare of the Sun.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:101529:82"/>
               <p> The <hi>Goosberry-Tree</hi> being one of the <note place="margin">Goosberry-Wine.</note> greateſt Fruit-bearing Shrubs, yields a pleaſant Fruit, which although ſomewhat luſcious, yet by reaſon of its groſs Lee, whereof it is full, it is apt to become acid, unleſs a proportion of Water ſweetned with Sugar (but not with ſo much as the other acid-Liquors) be added unto it; this Liquor of any other will not bear a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction becauſe it will debaſe its colour from a Wine colour to a brown not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in Whitiſh Wines or Liquors.</p>
               <p>There is no Shrub yields a more pleaſant <note place="margin">Rasberry-Wine.</note> Fruit than the <hi>Rasberry-Tree,</hi> which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Weed than a Tree, never living two years together above-ground. Nor is there any Fruit that yields a ſweeter and more pleaſant Juice than this, which being extracted ſerves not only to add a flavour to moſt other Wines or Liquors, but by a ſmall addition of Water and Sugar boyl'd together, and when cold, added to this Juice, and purified makes one of the moſt pleaſant drinks in the World.</p>
               <p>Having given you a taſte of moſt Wines <note place="margin">Apricock-Wine.</note> made by preſſure of the Juices out of the Fruits. You may alſo divert your ſelf with the blood of the Grape or any other of the before-mentioned Limpid Liquors,

               </head>
               <p>Beſides ſuch Drinks or Liquors that are commonly made of the Fruits of Trees or Shrubs, there are ſeveral other pleaſant, wholeſome, and neceſſary Drinks, made of Trees, Leaves, Grains, mixtures of ſeveral things, that are not to be omitted or want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your Conſervatory to make it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Metheglin</hi> or <hi>Hydromel,</hi> that is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared out of <hi>Hony</hi> extracted by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Bee out of ſeveral Vegetables, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the moſt pleaſant and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Drinks the Northern part of <hi>Europe</hi> affords, and was in uſe among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:101529:83"/> that inhabited theſe colder Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, before Wine or other Vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors became ſo generally uſed; and is yet in ſeveral cold Countries the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Drink that they have of their own making, where Wines and other Vinous Liquors are not ſo eaſily nor well prepared. The Subject whereof it is made, <hi>Honey,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be had in every part of <hi>Europe,</hi> from the moſt Southerly parts of <hi>Spain, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. to the moſt Northerly. It being affirm'd by <hi>Hiſtoriographers,</hi> that there is <hi>Hony</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Arctick-Circle</hi> or Frozen Zone.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that liv'd formerly in the more Southern parts (as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports) made a Drink compounded of <hi>Hony</hi> and tart Wine, which they term'd <hi>Melitites,</hi> by the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Gallon of <hi>Hony</hi> to five Gallons of their Wine, making thereof no doubt a very pleaſant Liquor: to which <hi>Virgil</hi> ſeems to allude, when he ſings</p>

                  <l>Not only ſweet, but ſhall be purely ſine,</l>
                  <l>And ſit to qualify your ſharpeſt Wine.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>This Drink was alſo called <hi>Oinomel</hi> by <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and others in that Age.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Swedeland, Muſcovia, Ruſſia,</hi> and as far as the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea, they make great ſtore of this Drink, and <hi>Meth,</hi> which is a ſmaller ſort of it, made of the worſt <hi>Honey,</hi> and of the refuſe of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Metheglin</hi> or <hi>Hydromel,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in thoſe cold Countries before any other Drinks, preparing it diverſly to pleaſe their Palates; The beſt receipt whereof that I have obſerved to be made by them is thus.</p>
               <p>They take <hi>Rasberries</hi> which grow plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in thoſe parts, and put them into fair Water, for two or three Nights (I ſuppoſe they bruiſe them firſt) that the Water may extract their taſte and colour. Into this Water they put of the pureſt <hi>Honey,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion about one pound of <hi>Honey</hi> to three or four of Water; according as they would have it ſtronger or ſmaller. Then to give it a fermentation, they put a Toſt into it dipp'd in the Dregs or Grounds of Beer;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101529:84"/> which when it hath ſet the <hi>Metheglin</hi> at work, they take out again, to prevent any ill Savour it may give; if they deſire to ferment it long, they ſet in a warm place; which when they pleaſe to hinder or ſtop, they remove it into a cool place; after it hath done fermenting, they draw it off the Lee for preſent uſe; to add to its excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they hang in it a little bagg wherein is <hi>Cinamon, Grains</hi> of Paradice, and a few <hi>Cloves.</hi> This may do very well for preſent drinking. But if you would make your <hi>Metheglin</hi> of the ſame ingredients, and to be kept (time meliorating any ſort of Drinks) you may preſerve your Juice of <hi>Rasberries</hi> at their proper ſeaſon. And when you make your <hi>Metheglin,</hi> decoct your <hi>Honey</hi> and Water together, and when it is cold, then add your Juice of <hi>Rasber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> which was before prepared to keep, and purify your <hi>Metheglin</hi> by the means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſcrib'd, or ferment it, either by a Toſt dipped in Yeſt, or by putting a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Yeſt unto it, to which you may add the little bag of Spices before mentioned. Then let it ſtand about a Month to be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly purified, and then bottle it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it for uſe, and it may in time become a curious Drink.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:101529:85"/>
               <p> They alſo ſteep <hi>Rasberries</hi> in <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> twenty-four hours, and adde that to their <hi>Hydromel;</hi> which is a great amendment of it.</p>
               <p>The ſame people alſo extract the Jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Strawberries, Mulberries,</hi> and <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and make the ſame uſe of them in their <hi>Hydromel,</hi> as they did of the <hi>Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many Receipts are handed from one to another, for the making of <hi>Metheglin</hi> or <hi>Hydromel,</hi> wherein are ſeveral green Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables preſcribed to be uſed, as <hi>Sweet-Bryar-Leaves, Thyme, Roſemary, &amp;c.</hi> which are not to be uſed green, by them that intend to make a quick, brisk and lively Drink; green and crude herbs dulling and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Spirits of the Liquor to which they are added, as you will finde if you adde green <hi>Hops</hi> inſtead of dry to your Beer: neither will any green herb yield its vertue ſo eaſily as when dry. But Spices and <hi>Aromatick</hi> herbs are very neceſſary to adde a flavour to the <hi>Metheglin,</hi> and abate its too luſcious taſte.</p>
               <p>It is uſually alſo directed, that the <hi>Metheglin</hi> when boyling, ſhould be ſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to take off the filth that ariſeth from it in the decoction: which is not
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101529:85"/> ſo neceſſary as it is pretended to be; for that ſcum remaining behind, will be of uſe, and a help to its fermentation, and makes the Liquor afterwards to become the more limpid; and doth not unite again with it, as is vulgarly believed, it being a Maxime in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that Feces once ſeparated, will never re-unite.</p>
               <p>So that if you take <hi>Honey, Live-Honey,</hi> that naturally runs from the Combs, (and that from Swarms of the ſame year is the beſt) &amp; adde ſo much <hi>Honey</hi> to clear Spring-Water, that when the <hi>Honey</hi> is diſſolved thorowly, an Egg will not ſink to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, but eaſily ſwim up and down in it; Then boyl this Liquor in a Braſs, or rather Copper Veſſel, for about an hour or more; and by that time the Egg will ſwim above the Liquor, about the breadth of a Groat, then let it cool; the next morning you may barrel it up, adding to the proportion of fifteen Gallons an ounce of <hi>Ginger,</hi> half an ounce of <hi>Cinamou, Cloves</hi> and <hi>Mace</hi> of each an ounce, all groſly beaten, for if you beat it fine, it will always float in your <hi>Metheglin,</hi> and make it foul; and if you put it in whilſt it is hot, the Spices will loſe their Spirits. You may alſo if you pleaſe adde a little ſpoonful of Yeſt at the Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101529:86"/> to encreaſe its fermentation, but let it not ſtand too cold at the firſt, that being a principal impediment to its fermentation; as ſoon as it hath done working, ſtop it up cloſe, and let it ſtand for a Month, then draw it into Bottles, which if ſet in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigeratory, as before was directed for <hi>Cider,</hi> it will become a moſt pleaſant Vinous Drink, dayly looſing its luſcious taſte; the longer it is kept, the better it will be.</p>
               <p>By the ſloating of the Egg you may judg of its ſtrength, and you may make it more or leſs ſtrong as you pleaſe by adding of more <hi>Honey,</hi> or more Water.</p>
               <p>By long boyling it is made more pleaſant and more durable.</p>
               <p>As well in theſe Northern parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> as in many places of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of</hi> Birtch-Wine.</note> may we extract the Blood of Trees them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and make them drinkable. The delicacy of our Liquors made of Fruits and Grains, very much abates the eager proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſuch deſignes, yet the pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſalubrity of the Blood of ſeveral Trees, have given encouragement, to ſome <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> to beſtow their labour and ſkill on them, and not in vain, The <hi>Sycomore</hi> and <hi>Wallnut-Trees</hi> are ſaid to yield excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le at Juice, but we in <hi>England</hi> have not had ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101529:86"/> great experience in any, as in that of the <hi>Birch-tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which may be extracted in very great quantities where thoſe Trees are plenty, many Gallons in a day may be gathered from the Boughs of the Tree by cutting them of leaving their ends fit to go into the mouths of the Bottles, and ſo by hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many Bottles on ſeveral Boughs, the Liquor will diſtil into them very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon for this work, is from the end of <hi>February</hi> to the end of <hi>March,</hi> whilſt the Sap riſes, and before the Leaves ſhoot out from the Tree; for when the Spring is forward and the Leaves begin to appear, the Juice, by a long digeſtion in the Branch, grows thick and coloured, which before was thin and limpid. The Sap alſo diſtils not in cold weather, whilſt the <hi>North</hi> and Eaſt-winds blow, nor in the night time, but very well and freely when the <hi>South</hi> or Weſt-winds blow, or the Sun ſhine warm.</p>
               <p>That Liquor is beſt that proceeds from the Branches, having had a longer time in the Tree, and thereby better digeſted and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring more of its flavour, than if it had been extracted from the Trunk.</p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:101529:87"/>
               <p> Thus may many Hogſheads ſoon be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd: Poor people will (where Trees are plenty) draw it for two pence or three pence the Gallon. To every Gallon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, adde a pound of refined Sugar, and boyl it about a quarter or half an hour; then ſet it to cool, and adde a very little Yeſt to it, and it will ferment, and thereby purge it ſelf from that little droſs the Liquor and Sugar can yield: then put it in a Barrel, and adde thereto a ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Cinamon</hi> and <hi>Mace</hi> bruiſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an ounce of both to ten Gallons; then ſtop it very cloſe, and about a month after bottle it; and in a few days you will have a moſt delicate briſk <hi>Wine</hi> of a Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour like unto <hi>Rheniſh.</hi> Its Spirits are ſo volatile, that they are apt to break the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, unleſs placed in a Refrigeratory, and give it a white head in the Glaſs. This Liquor is not of long duration, unleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved very cool.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of every pound of Sugar, if you adde a quart of Honey and boyl it as before, and adding Spice, and fermenting it as you ſhould do <hi>Metheglin,</hi> it makes an admired Drink, both pleaſant and medicinable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ale</hi> brewed of this Juice or Sap, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd very wholeſome.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:101529:87"/>

               <p>To this Fruit they adde <hi>Achiote,</hi> which is made of the red Kernels of another Fruit there growing, by decocting them to a Pap, whereof they make Cakes.

The Leaves thus roll'd are again hang'd over the fire, and then roll'd cloſer together till they are dry, then put up carefully in Tin Veſſels, to preſerve them from moiſture. Thus they prepare and preſerve their beſt Leaves that yield the greateſt rates, but the ordinary they onely dry in the Sun; but in the ſhade is doubtleſs much better, the Sun having a great power to attract the vertue out of any Vegetable after its ſeparation from its Nouriſher.</p>
               <p>Boyl a quart of clean water, and then adde to it a few of theſe dry Leaves, which you may take up at once between the tops of your fingers, and let them thus ſtand in a covered Pot two or three mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, in which time the Leaves will be ſpread to their former breadth and ſhape, and yield their bitter, yet pleaſant taſte.

               <p>I am unwilling to trouble you with ſo exact an account as may be taken, how many greater and leſſer Trees ſhould be planted on an hundred or one thouſand Acres of Land, at ſo many foot and inches diſtance, like what of late hath been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the world, by an account to an <hi>Acorn,</hi> how many of them will plant one thouſand Acres of Land at a foot diſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> having more of nicety than diſcretion in it; onely you may conclude, that one hundred <hi>Apple-trees</hi> may be planted in an Acre of ground at about twenty foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; which is a good ſize for the <hi>Red-ſtreak,</hi> that Tree never growing very large: the greater diſtance you plant them at, the fewer will be required: Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo muſt be had to the goodneſs of the Land; a dry hungry Soil requiring more Trees: than a more liberal, becauſe the Trees will rarely be very large; and the more they ſhadow the ground, the better, as before was obſerved.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:101529:89"/>
               <p> The Rates and Prizes of planting one hundred of theſe Trees, are alſo eaſily to be computed; you may have them at the Gardeners, brought home, planted, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, if they require it, for about five pound the hundred.</p>
               <p>The yearly profit of the Herbage or Tillage of this Acre of Ground for the firſt ſeven years after planting, may well be employed in digging about the Roots of the Trees, carrying off convenient and proper Soil or compoſt for them, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Fences, paying Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At ſeven years end, theſe one hundred Trees may, one Tree with another, yield a buſhel of Apples each Tree: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not to be denied, but that ſome of them may have periſhed, and others, as yet but young, raiſed in their places, yet may ſome of theſe Trees at ſeven years growth bear two or three buſhels, and ſome a buſhel and a half, which may in the whole make one hundred buſhels, which at ſix pence <hi>per</hi> buſhel is fifty ſhillings; the Herbage then will be worth at leaſt twenty ſhillings <hi>per annum,</hi> although the Ground were worth leſs before it was planted: The eighth or ninth year your Trees may, one with another, and one year with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101529:90"/> yield you at leaſt two or three buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els on a Tree, and ſometimes more; which at ſo low a rate, your five pound firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and the forbearance of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of your Land, and intereſt of your Money for ſeven years, will bring you in at the leaſt five pound <hi>per annum,</hi> the Herbage being ſtill allowed for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of your Plantation.</p>
               <p>But if a good Fruit-year happen, and your one hundred Trees yield you four or five hundred buſhels of Fruit, and thoſe worth twelve pence or eighteen pence the buſhel, it will, in one year, more than retaliate all your paſt labour, charge, and loſs.</p>
               <p>The like Calculation might be made of the profits ariſing from the propagating of ſeveral other ſorts of the before-mentioned Fruits; but he that underſtands the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of planting them, will eaſily compute the advantage.</p>

               <p>It is not to be expected that I ſhould here give you an exact account of the effects theſe Fruits and Wines have on humane bodies, it more becoming a Gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the Medicinal Science. But to abate what any may enviouſly object againſt the ſalubrity of them, and to encourage our Country-men in the uſe of them, I ſhall here give you what have been generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be the vertues of ſeveral of our Country Fruits and Wines.</p>
               <p>As to Gardens and Orchards themſelves, <note place="margin">Of Gardens and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards.</note> they have been eſteem'd the pureſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane pleaſures, and the greateſt refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Spirits of man: for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of planting, grafting, pruning, and walking in them, very much tendeth to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:101529:92"/> Salubrity, as alſo doth the wholeſome Airs found in them, which have been experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced not onely to cure ſeveral Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers incident to our nature, but to tend towards the prolongation of life.</p>
               <p>The Fruits of the Earth, and eſpecially <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Of Apples and</hi> Cider.</note> of Trees, were the firſt Food ordained for man to eat, and by eating of which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fleſh became his meat) he lived to a far greater age, than ſince any have been obſerved to have lived. And of all the Fruits our <hi>Northern</hi> parts produce, there's none more edible, nor more wholeſome, than Apples; which by the various prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Cook, are become a part of our Table-entertainment almoſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the year, and are eſteem'd to be very temperate and nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>They relax the Belly, which is a very good property in them; but the ſweet more than the ſharp.</p>
               <p>They help Concoction, eaten after meat with a little Bread: you may be confident that an Apple eaten after ſupper, depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all offenſive vapours that otherwiſe would offend the Head, and hinder ſleep.</p>
               <p>Apples roſted, ſcalded, or otherwiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, according to the ſkill of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, are good in many hot Diſeaſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <p>The <hi>Pearmain,</hi> whereof there are two or three ſorts, is ſo excellent an Apple, and ſo well known, that no more need be ſaid of it; only the larger ſort is more pulpy than the ſmaller, and keeps not ſo well; neither is the <hi>Summer-Pearmain</hi> ſo good as the Winter. They are all very good Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Apples, but not to be preferr'd to your Cider-Plantation, being no great Bearers.</p>

They are generally very pleaſant Fruit, and of a good Juice, fit for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Conſervatory and Kitchin; but not ſo fit for our Plantation for <hi>Cider,</hi> as the more ordinary Fruit, being but tender bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:101529:97"/>
               <p> The <hi>Kirton-pippin</hi> is one of the beſt ſorts of Table-fruit of that ſeaſon, which is from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to <hi>Alhollantide,</hi> and yields very good <hi>Cider.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Carliſle-Pippin,</hi> and the <hi>Bridgwater-Pippin,</hi> are much commended for excellent Table-Fruits.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Golden-Rennet</hi> is a very pleaſant and fair Fruit, of a yellow Fleſh, a good bearer, and yields a very good Juice, and to be preferred in our Plantation for all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Leather-Coat,</hi> or <hi>Golden-Ruſſeting,</hi> as ſome call it, is a very good Winter-Fruit, living long, and of a good firm and yellow Fleſh.</p>

               <p>The <hi>John-Apple,</hi> or <hi>Deux-ans,</hi> ſo called from its durableneſs, continuing two years before it periſheth, is a good reliſht ſharp Apple the Spring following, when moſt other Fruit is ſpent; although there are ſome Pippins will out-live them. The
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101529:97"/> 
                  <hi>Deux-ans</hi> are not fit for our Cider-Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being a dry Fruit, and as ſome report, that little Juice they have, not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Marigold-Apple,</hi> (ſo called from its being marked in even ſtripes in the form of a <hi>Marigold;</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Onyon-Apple,</hi> from the reddiſh brown Colour, reſembling a well-coloured Onyon; ſometimes called the <hi>Kate-Apple,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Johns Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> from its likeneſs to a <hi>Pearmain)</hi> is a very good Fruit, long laſting, and fit for the Table, Conſervatory, Kitchin, or the Preſs, yielding a very good Juice, and to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated in your Cider-Plantation, bearing every other year, even to admiration; the intervening years but a few.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Harvey-Apple,</hi> and the <hi>Round-Ruſſet-Harvey,</hi> are both excellent Fruits for the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and were they great bearers, no doubt but they would yield excellent Liquor.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Queen-Apple,</hi> thoſe that are of the Summer, are excellent Cider-Apples mixt with other, being of themſelves ſweet. The <hi>Winter-Queening</hi> is a good Table-Fruit.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Pome-Roy,</hi> is a Fruit of a high name,

               <p>The <hi>Pome-water</hi> is an indifferent good laſting Fruit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Golden-Doucet,</hi> or <hi>Golden-ducket,</hi> is much commended.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Weſtberry-Apple,</hi> taking its name from <hi>Weſtberry</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> from whence they are much diſperſed into the adjacent parts, its one of the moſt ſolid Apples that grows, of a tough rind, and obdurate Fleſh, ſharp and quick taſte, long laſting, and yields a very excellent and plentiful Juice, making a <hi>Cider</hi> equal to the beſt of Fruits, and for the Kitchin few or none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Gilliflower-Apple</hi> is of a pleaſant Hautguſt, and long laſting, of a thick Rinde, and hard Core, well ſtrip'd, and good for <hi>Cider,</hi> making an excellent mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Of early Apples, the <hi>Margaret-Apple</hi> is the beſt and moſt early, uſually Ripe about St. <hi>Margarets</hi> day in <hi>June.</hi> It is a fair and beautiful Fruit, and of a pleaſant taſte and ſcent, not to be match'd at that ſeaſon for the Table and Kitchin, and deſerves a more general propagation.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Codling,</hi> ſo called from the uſe it is put unto, is a very neceſſary Apple in the Kitchin, and makes a good Summer-Cider.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Claret-wine-apple</hi> is fair, and yields plenty of a pleaſant ſharp Juice, from which it takes its name, and not from the Colour, it being a white Apple; but makes a rich Vinous Liquor, which well ordered excells moſt of other <hi>Ciders,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially with a mixture of ſweet Apples.</p>
               <p>The <hi>White-Wining,</hi> is a ſmall white Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Tree is a great bearer, and the fruit juicy and pleaſant, but ſoon periſhing, and the <hi>Cider</hi> made thereof ſmall.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King-Apple,</hi> though not common, yet is by ſome eſteemed an excellent Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and preferr'd to the <hi>Jenniting.</hi>

               <p>Sweet Apples there are of ſeveral ſorts, and their names change in every place; ſo that they are rather known by their colour and ſize, than their names.

               <p>Alſo, I have ſeen formerly a <hi>Rasberry</hi> of a much darker colour than the Red, which was then termed the <hi>Black-rasberry,</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pleaſant in taſte.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Rasberry-tree</hi> larger in Stalk and Leaves than any of the former, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very large Bloſſome; but no Fruit comes to perfection of it in this Country.</p>

                  <hi>Medlars</hi> are a pleaſing Fruit, and in ſome <note place="margin">Medlars.</note> caſes Medicinal; whereof there are ſeveral kinds.</p>
               <p>The Common Engliſh, being but ſmall, and the <hi>Great Dutch-medlar,</hi> which is much larger than the other, and is a good bearer.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:101529:110"/>
               <p> Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> mentions a ſort that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtones, which are a great curioſity.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Neapolitan Medlar,</hi> much like the former, without ſtones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Services</hi> are a Fruit more common than <note place="margin">Services.</note> deſirable, therefore I ſhall onely name them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cornel-tree</hi> beareth the Fruit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly <note place="margin">Cornelians.</note> called the <hi>Cornelian-cherry,</hi> as well from the name of the Tree, as the <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian-ſtone,</hi> the colour whereof it ſomewhat repreſents. This Fruit is good in the Kitchin and Conſervatory.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mulberry-tree</hi> deſerves more room <note place="margin">Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> in our Engliſh Plantations, rather for the Leaf than the Fruit. Of <hi>Mulberries</hi> there are three ſorts:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Black</hi> or <hi>Red-mulberry</hi> is known to moſt; the <hi>White-mulberry</hi> is ſmaller in the Tree and Fruit; the <hi>Virginian-mulberry</hi> is quicker of growth than the former, and its Fruit larger, and as pleaſant. Theſe Fruits are not to be ſlighted in the Kitchin and Conſervatory, nor for their Juice.</p>
               <p>Although the <hi>Strawberry</hi> grows not on <note place="margin">Strawber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> a Tree, and therefore cannot be eſteemed an Orchard-fruit, yet they deſerve a place under them, being humble, and content with the ſhades and droppings of your

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Common Engliſh-ſtrawberry,</hi> well known to all, and much improved by tranſplanting them from the Woods to the Garden.</p>
               <p>The <hi>White-ſtrawberry,</hi> more delicate than the former.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Long Red-ſtrawberry,</hi> not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo good as the former.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polonian</hi> or <hi>Great Strawberry</hi> is the largeſt of all <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rasberry,</hi> or <hi>Green-ſtrawberry,</hi> is the ſweeteſt of all <hi>Strawberries,</hi> and lateſt ripe.</p>
               <p>But the beſt of all <hi>Strawberries,</hi> is that kind lately brought out of <hi>New-England,</hi> where, and throughout the <hi>American</hi> coaſt, they grow in great plenty, and are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated here in <hi>England.</hi> They are the moſt early of all Engliſh-fruits, ſeveral years being ripe the firſt week in <hi>May,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue bearing plentifully until Midſummer, unleſs drought prevent them. They are the faireſt (except the <hi>Polonian)</hi> and of the beſt Scarlet dye of any Fruit that grows, and very pleaſant and cool to the
